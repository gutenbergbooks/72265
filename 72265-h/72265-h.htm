W. H. MUDFORD, <span class="sc">Esq</span>.</h2>

<p class="nind"><span class="sc">My dear Mudford</span>,—Although
the days of patrons and of epistles dedicatory have passed away, it
is still permissible to inscribe the name of a friend on the
fly-leaf of a book. I venture, therefore, to associate your name
with this trifling record of a pleasant holiday trip. I do so not
because you were in a certain sense connected with part of my
experiences in Tunis, nor even because in common with all who have
any knowledge of the Press I recognize and rejoice in the great
position you have gained in English Journalism; but because I wish
to keep alive the memory of times long past, when you and I were
bound together by the ties of an intimacy that was personal as well
as professional,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_viii">[viii]</span>
and that did not a little to cheer and strengthen me in a dark
crisis of my life.</p>

<p>“Able editors,” though they are by no means common in this
world, may still by a happy chance be met with at any period of
one’s existence; but after a man has reached a certain age, if he
does not cease to make friends he at least discovers that he cannot
afford to part with any of those whom he made whilst he was still
young. It is therefore rather to my old friend, than to the
journalist who has done much to revive the best traditions of the
English Press, that I ask leave to dedicate this simple story; and
whilst I do so, may I add the expression of a hope that many years
of usefulness and honour still lie before you?</p>

<p class="right pad-right4">Yours always,</p>

<p class="right pad-right2"><span class="sc">T. Wemyss

</div>

<p class="nind"><span class="sc">Recent</span> events have
attracted so much attention to Northern Africa, and to that part of
it over which the Bey of Tunis has hitherto ruled, that it seems
unnecessary to offer any apology for the publication of this
volume. But if an apology is unnecessary, an explanation is
undoubtedly called for. Let me say then that I make no pretensions
to any special knowledge of Tunis. I have not attempted to write a
history of the Regency—though such a history could hardly fail to
be intensely interesting; nor have I even sought to give a complete
account of the country as it is now to be seen by visitors from a
distance. Several circumstances made it impossible that I
should<span class="pagenum" id="Page_x">[x]</span> do this. During
the time I spent in Tunis, as will be gathered from the following
pages, the country was not only in a state of war, but was under
the influence of a very vehement anti-Christian feeling. That
feeling had found expression in hideous massacres of Christians who
had fallen into the hands of the so-called “insurgent Arabs.”
French armies were in occupation of different points in the
Regency, and were about to begin the march to the sacred city of
Kairwan; and Tunis itself had, as a matter of precaution, been
strongly occupied by the soldiers of the Republic. As a result of
this state of things it had become dangerous for any Christian to
go beyond the very limited districts in which the French troops
were actually posted. Even in Tunis itself it was perilous to visit
certain quarters of the city at any time, and after dark no
European could walk about the streets safely. Consequently it was
not possible for a visitor at this particular moment to see so much
of the country<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xi">[xi]</span> as he
could have done under happier circumstances—or, indeed, so much of
it as he may see now, when there appears to be a temporary lull in
the excitement of the Arab population. My story therefore is not a
complete one. But I have endeavoured to tell, as simply and
honestly as possible, the tale of a brief visit paid to the Regency
at a very exciting time, and to give some account of the many
scenes and persons of interest I encountered during my sojourn in
the Land of the Bey. As it happened, I had some advantages as a
traveller which enabled me to meet with people and to enter houses
not usually accessible to Englishmen; and I have sought to tell an
unvarnished and straightforward story about them. I might have
added a great deal of information about the Regency generally, and
the city of Kairwan in particular, for I gathered not a little
knowledge of these subjects whilst I was in Tunis; but since I left
the country Kairwan itself has been visited by
Europeans,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xii">[xii]</span> and is
now accessible to travellers, and I do not think it desirable
therefore to inflict my secondhand evidence upon the reader. If
what I have written of my own experiences and actual observations
should induce him to follow my example, and to spend a holiday in
Tunis, I feel certain that he will consider himself well repaid for
his pains by the enjoyment which the novel and picturesque sights
of that strange and romantic land cannot fail to afford him.</p>

<p class="sch">HOW I ATE BOUILLABAISSE AT MARSEILLES.</p>

<p class="csum">A mad holiday scheme — Prophecies of evil — Paris
after rain — In the “Rapide” — Marseilles — A dish of
Bouillabaisse, and a disillusionment.</p>

<p class="nind">“Go to Tunis!” cried all my friends, when I
intimated my intention of taking a holiday in that little-visited
district of Northern Africa; “why, you must be mad to think of it.”
And then from each in succession there was poured forth a catalogue
of the dangers, difficulties, and hardships which I was certain to
encounter if I ventured into the dominions of the Bey. “Do you not
know that the country is in a state of war; that a French army is
on the point of occupying the city of Tunis itself; that the Arabs
are murdering every European they can catch, and the French, not to
be behind them, are doing the same by the Arabs?” “Have you read
those<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span> horrible
revelations about the prevalence of typhoid fever in Tunis? They
say they are dying there by hundreds daily.” “Do you know what the
African climate is? Have you any conception of the heat of an
African sun?” These were but specimens of the admonitions poured
into my unheeding ears by my kind friends.</p>

<p>The truth was that my determination to visit Tunis dated from a
lovely day in October, 1880, when, sailing in the good ship
<em>Sidon</em> towards Malta, I had the entrance to the Gulf of
Tunis pointed out to me. Until that moment, although I had often
looked at the place upon the map, I had never thoroughly realized
its nearness to the shores of Europe. Tunis had seemed like Morocco
or Timbuctoo or Lake N’gami, a mysterious spot shut out from the
civilized world. But when I saw that this land in which the manners
and customs of the East are to be found to-day in a degree of
perfection which is unknown at Stamboul, was within four-and-twenty
hours’ sail of Malta, I inwardly resolved that, if the Fates were
propitious, I should make it the goal of my next year’s
holiday.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span>Between that trip in
the <em>Sidon</em> and my voyage in the following year a good many
things had happened at Tunis. M. Roustan, aided by his accomplices
in Paris, had planned and carried out the greatest act of
international brigandage upon record, and unoffending Tunis had
been violently seized by the French army in the name of a gang of
mercenary conspirators. The hot-blooded Arabs and Moors of the
regency had not been slow to resent the usurpation of the infidel,
and a bitter war had begun. It was in the very midst of this war,
on the day on which a French army entered the city of Tunis itself
and made themselves masters of the capital, that I set off on my
journey from a Yorkshire town to an African State. I propose to
tell the story of that journey in some detail in these pages; for
it was one of singular interest, albeit accompanied by more than
one unpleasant adventure, and attended at times by an amount of
discomfort that often caused me to smile grimly at the notion that
I was engaged upon a pleasure excursion. In describing my
experiences, I shall quote largely from the diary which I kept from
day to day all through my journey;<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_4">[4]</span> but if at any moment I feel inclined to dwell
upon a particular scene or incident, the reader will forgive me if
I lay my diary aside, and enlarge upon the rough notes made upon
the spot. I can promise him that whether in quoting from my diary
or in giving a detailed description of the various scenes I
witnessed—some of which were of more than ordinary interest—I shall
do my best to keep most strictly within the limits of the
truth.</p>

<p>Circumstances not unconnected with an important incident in the
political history of Leeds reduced the amount of time at my
disposal for preparation for the journey to a few hours. Still the
time was sufficient to enable me to lay in the stock of light
summer clothing that I required. I shall not soon forget the amazed
look of a certain shop-keeper in Briggate, when on a stormy October
day I ransacked his stores in search of his lightest neck-ties,
handkerchiefs, stockings, and hats, such as, in his opinion, could
only be worn in the hottest days of an English summer. A revolver,
a box of quinine pills, and some other simple medicines, a portable
filter, a very large bottle of vermin powder, and a goodly flask
filled with the finest brandy<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_5">[5]</span> formed part of my equipment. The brandy, like
the medicine, was carefully set aside for an emergency; not to be
used, in fact, save in case of illness. In due time the emergency
arrived, and I then found the provision I had made for it
invaluable.</p>

<p><em>Wednesday, October 12th</em>, 1881.—There is always
something to be done at the last moment. Starting from my hotel
this morning to catch the tidal express at Charing Cross, I made
the melancholy discovery that I had lost the key of one of my
portmanteaus, which accordingly could not be locked. I knew what a
railway journey from London to Marseilles with an open portmanteau
portended, and not wishing to lose half my effects before I reached
the shores of the Mediterranean, I set about procuring another key.
There was very little time to spare. I dashed into one shop after
another in the Strand, and finally, just in the nick of time, got
what I wanted. There was a great crowd of passengers at Charing
Cross, and the usual bustle and confusion in getting the baggage
registered. But at eleven o’clock punctually the train started to
run through the beautiful country between London and
Folkestone.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span> The day was
dull and raw, and the southern suburbs of the metropolis looked
melancholy enough in that damp atmosphere; but one’s eye rested
lovingly upon them, as each successive name at the wayside stations
recalled some happy incident in “the days that are no more.” My
travelling companions to Folkestone were a returned Australian, who
had left England when he was two years old, and an Irish gentleman
and his pretty sisters. “Remember, girls,” said the Irishman as we
drew near to Folkestone, “that sea-sickness is not an affection of
the stomach but of the brain. All you have to do is to bear that
fact in mind, and there will be no fear of your being
sea-sick.”</p>

<p>Folkestone was in gala dress when we reached the place. In spite
of the wind and rain the little town was crowded; bands of music
were playing, flags were flying, and cannon were being fired. The
Prince and Princess of Wales were laying the foundation-stone of
some new docks, so that our last look at England showed us a loyal
population yelling themselves hoarse round the carriage in which
rode the heir-apparent and his pretty wife. Before we got clear of
Folkestone<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span> harbour the
wind had increased to half a gale, and no sooner were we outside
than our wretched little boat began to pitch and roll horribly.
Then followed the usual scene. There were 220 passengers on board,
and before long fully 200 of these were groaning and writhing in
the agonies of sea-sickness. Even those who were proof against the
malady—among whom I could happily count myself—had an uncomfortable
time of it, for the vessel shipped an immense quantity of water. I
had, of course, packed my waterproof in one of my portmanteaus, so
that I was quickly drenched to the skin, my through ticket to
Marseilles being reduced to something like a state of pulp. Among
the earliest of those who succumbed to the sea was my Irish friend
of the railway train. Either there was a flaw in his theory
concerning sea-sickness, or, like certain other preachers, he
expounded doctrines which his own faith was too weak to enable him
to accept. The grey, storm-laden sky, the broken foam-topped waves,
and the labouring boat, wrapped in its cloud of spray, made up a
fine picture; but the groans of misery all around me, and the
sights and smells of the<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_8">[8]</span> vessel detracted greatly from one’s enjoyment
of it.</p>

<p>After a passage of nearly three hours’ duration we reached
Boulogne. Some of the passengers had suffered so much that they
decided to stay there for the night, but, of course, most of us
went on to Paris, after paying the usual exorbitant tax to the
keeper of the <em>buffet</em>. We had a curious assemblage in the
carriage in which I found a seat. There was a shabbily-dressed old
gentleman who persistently smoked a black wooden pipe, and whom I
eventually discovered to be an English general on his way to his
post in India, another Indian going out to manage a
newly-discovered gold-mine, a smart young fellow bound for China,
myself for Tunis, and three pleasure-seeking tourists intent upon
Paris and the Rhine, one of whom I recognized as an old
schoolfellow of my own. We reached Paris at 10.30 instead of eight.
So much for Sir Edward Watkin’s performances as compared with his
promises. After a long detention at the Custom House, where,
however, the usual civility was shown to us, I and the two
travellers to India found quarters in the Grand Hotel, the
familiar<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span> courtyard of
which I find is now lighted by electricity.</p>

<p><em>Thursday, October 13th</em>.—A beautiful morning after
yesterday’s rain and storm. Paris was looking her best when I
strolled out after my first breakfast, to secure a place in the
sleeping-car for Marseilles and a berth for Tunis. The
sleeping-car, alas! is not yet on the line. “It will be put on
to-morrow.” I always find when I miss a good thing of this sort
that if I could only wait till to-morrow it would be all right.
Among misleading proverbs there is none that more urgently requires
revision than that about “the early bird.” Or perhaps I am one of
those unfortunates who are doomed by circumstances to take the
worm’s view of the situation. I do not find there will be any
difficulty in getting a berth in to-morrow’s steamer from
Marseilles to Tunis. “Monsieur, nobody goes there at present,” says
the clerk in the office of the Transatlantic Company when I inquire
upon the subject. I drive up the beautiful Champs Elysées to call
upon the L.’s. How charming Paris looks to-day in the bright
sunshine, with the trees just beginning to assume the tints
of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span> autumn! One feels
all the temptations of the spot strong upon one, and there is an
urgent desire to inquire whether a later boat might not be just as
suitable as to-morrow’s for the voyage.</p>

<p>After luncheon, during which Mrs. L. expresses her horror at the
notion of any one visiting Tunis for pleasure at this moment, I go
to the Ministry of War, accompanied by L., in order to ascertain if
any special permission is needed to get into Tunis. A very polite
official distinctly assures me that nothing of the kind is
required, and that I can not only enter Tunis, but travel about in
it as freely as I please. “Or rather as the Arabs please,” I think
of suggesting; but upon second thoughts it strikes me that the joke
might not be appreciated. Before I tear myself away from the
flesh-pots of Egypt, I must have one good dinner at least; so we
betake ourselves to Champeau’s, close to the Bourse, and there
indulge in those “luxuries of the Salt Market,” which I cannot hope
to carry with me across the Mediterranean. The dinner, which is
begun with oysters, is fairly good; but the bill for it is unfairly
big. This, however, is nothing to<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_11">[11]</span> what I have to face at the Grand Hotel, where
I am charged thirteen francs for my room on the fourth floor! As I
sit smoking a last cigar in the well-known courtyard, meditating
upon merry parties I have joined in here in former days, the
evening papers bring me the announcement of Parnell’s arrest. At
that moment my travelling companion of yesterday, General A———,
passes me, and I tell him the news. “Hurrah!” shouts the general,
regardless of the fashionable crowd around him, and his battered
hat goes spinning up into the air in token of his joy.</p>

<p><em>Friday, Oct. 14th.</em>—A night in a French train is always
a painful penance, and my journey from Paris to Marseilles has been
no exception to the rule. We started from the Lyons Railway Station
at twenty minutes past seven last night. Of course the carriage was
full. Happily, I succeeded in getting a seat facing one of the
windows, and I was thus able to ensure the admittance of a little
fresh air. Presently, as we stole onwards during the raw, dark
night I saw that the window at the other end of the carriage was
also open. I blessed my fate which had sent me as a travelling
companion a Frenchman<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
who actually liked fresh air. I was still marvelling over the
mystery of the existence of such a being when the gentleman who was
keeping guard over that window, addressed me in excellent English.
“Oh,” I said, “you’re an Englishman, are you? That explains your
open window. But why did you speak to me in French before?”
“Because I thought you were a Frenchman; and it was only when I saw
<em>your</em> open window that I knew you weren’t.” Needless to
say, the companionship of my new acquaintance, Captain A———, of the
Carlton Club, beguiled the journey, at any rate during its later
stages, when we had shaken off the somnolence of night.</p>

<p>It was quite cold towards dawn. When day broke we found
ourselves running through something which bore a suspicious
resemblance to an English November fog. And this was in Valence!
Clearly the “sunny south” had not yet been reached. At Avignon,
however, the fog had cleared off, and I could get a good view of
the famous ruins and admire the beautiful situation of the town.
From Avignon to Marseilles the sun became hotter and ever hotter.
The scenery<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span> on either
side of the line reminded me much of bits of Malta. There was the
same scanty covering of earth upon the white chalk-like rocks, and
the same semi-tropical vegetation. At last Marseilles itself was
reached, about an hour and a half behind time. Here it was as hot
and as glaring as on that day when the story of “Little Dorrit”
began, goodness knows how many years ago. I had some trouble in
getting my baggage out of the train; but I had at the same time
occasion to admire the courtesy and good arrangements of the
railway officials. When my portmanteaus had been placed in the cab,
an inspector asked me where I wished to be driven to, and then
handed me a printed paper on which he had filled up the amount to
which the cabman was entitled! I wonder when the unlucky foreigner
arriving in our beloved London will meet with a similar
attention.</p>

<p>Marseilles is much more picturesquely situated than I had
expected. It lies at the bottom of a fine bay, with jutting
promontories of high rocks running out into the Mediterranean on
either side. Behind it is a range of barren hills in the form of
an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span> amphitheatre. The
glare of white from the city and the surrounding country is
positively painful. As for the town itself, it reminded me in one
part of Glasgow—Glasgow with an Italian sky overhead!—in another
part of Paris, and in a third of Syra. It seems, indeed, to present
a curious admixture of different styles of street architecture; but
the prevailing type is decidedly Oriental. As I drove through the
glaring streets down to the dock where my steamer for Tunis lay, I
saw the <em>lazzaroni</em> lying sleeping in the noon-day sun, and,
among curious or unfamiliar spectacles, I had time to observe the
professional letter-writer in the Market-square, to whom a girl was
whispering some message of love or intrigue. It was delightful on
reaching the steamboat, a splendid Glasgow-built vessel, belonging
to the Transatlantic Company, to be able to indulge in a bath and a
change of linen. After that, as much refreshed as though I had been
in bed for the traditional eight hours, I set forth to keep
rendezvous with my travelling acquaintance, Captain A———, at the
Maison Dorée, in order that we might together partake of
Bouillabaisse.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>Do you know what
Bouillabaisse is, good reader? Possibly not; and yet I can hardly
suppose that you are ignorant of the name of this wonderful dish.
It has as high a place in English literature as the roast pig
immortalized by Charles Lamb. Has not Thackeray taken it as a title
of his most beautiful poem? You must have read that noble Ballad of
Bouillabaisse, and having read you can never have forgotten it.</p>

<div class="linegrp-container">

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="nind">Ever since I first read those immortal lines, I had
been longing for the chance of eating Bouillabaisse. I could no
longer do so in “the New Street of the Little Fields,” for Terré’s
Tavern has disappeared from the surface of the earth. But I knew
that Marseilles was the headquarters of Bouillabaisse, the spot
where alone it can be eaten in perfection;<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_16">[16]</span> and so I waited for the opportunity which had
now at last arrived.</p>

<div class="linegrp-container">
<div class="linegrp">
<div class="group">
<div class="line indent0">This Bouillabaisse a noble dish is—</div>

<div class="line indent2">A sort of soup or broth, or brew,</div>

<div class="line indent2">Soles, onions, garlic, roach, and

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="nind">So sings Thackeray. A———, who, like myself, had
never tasted the dish before, quoted the lines to me with
enthusiasm, and we prepared ourselves for a wondrous treat as we
sat in that cool, shady best dining-room of the Maison Dorée,
looking out through the green Venetian blinds upon the hot and
crowded Southern street. Alas! for disillusionment. When the
Bouillabaisse appeared we attacked it eagerly. It was a thick sort
of stew, in which there were many fishes, chiefly of the bony,
spiky description, a considerable quantity of red pepper, saffron,
and garlic, and an inordinate amount of bread.</p>

<p>A——— was the first to succumb. “I don’t care for it,” he said,
pushing his plate away, and gulping down a goblet of Burgundy. If I
had spoken the truth, I should have made the same admission; but
loyalty to my great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
Master kept me silent. Only for a minute or two, however. With
profound thankfulness I recognized the fact that my plate was
empty, and eagerly declined the invitation of the waiter to accept
of more. And this dismal fish curry was the far-famed
Bouillabaisse! Thackeray must have been more <em>gourmand</em> than
<em>gourmet</em> if he really liked it. But I consoled myself with
the thought that though Bouillabaisse might not be worth eating,
nothing could affect the charm of the immortal ballad, and whilst I
waited for the next course I quoted, quite inappropriately, a few
more lines from it:—</p>

<div class="linegrp-container">

<p class="nind">I had got so far in my sentimental rambling when a
voice I recognized fell upon my ear. I looked up, and lo! at the
next table sat a man whom I had last seen standing in front of the
Treasury Bench in the House of Commons, Sir Charles Dilke, the
Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs. And he, too, was making
believe to eat Bouillabaisse at the Maison Dorée at Marseilles. I
hope he liked it.</p>

<p class="sch">ON BOARD THE CHARLES QUINT.</p>

<p class="csum">A noble ship — Fellow-passengers — The vivandière —
Husbands and wives — A defect in the ship’s arrangements — “Why is
an Englishman never sea-sick?” — Bone — Hair-cutting made easy —
Colonel Allegro — The vivandière distinguishes herself — A sudden
change.</p>

<p><em>Marseilles, Friday, October 14th.</em>—The <em>Charles
Quint</em> is one of the newest and finest of the splendid line of
steamers recently built at Glasgow for the Compagnie Générale
Transatlantique of Marseilles. She was lying in the Joliette Dock
when, accompanied by the kindly Captain A———, who seemed loth to
part with me, I boarded her this afternoon. Nothing more luxurious
in the shape of a sea-going vessel has ever met my eyes. The saloon
is a marvel of beauty and elegance. Marble walls richly gilded,
luxurious arm-chairs, crimson couches, mirrors, carpets, pictures,
silver lamps, completely destroy for the moment the notion that one
is on board ship. You seem to be seated in the splendid apartment
of some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span> palace. The
state-rooms, too, are large, airy, and well found. My own is nearly
amidships, so I am well away from the grinding of the screw, whilst
close to me is a beautiful bath-room, the accommodation of which I
have already tested, where a bath of pure white marble might tempt
even the most nervous of Frenchmen to unwonted ablutions.</p>

<p>But it was not the remarkable completeness and elegance of the
furnishings of this noble ship that occupied my attention this
afternoon when, having at last said good-bye to my genial
fellow-countryman, I lounged on the broad hurricane-deck awaiting
the hour of our departure, which had been fixed for five o’clock.
The starting of a steamboat is always an interesting spectacle,
whether one witnesses it in a grimy Liverpool dock, a crowded
harbour in the Levant, or here under the glaring sunshine of
Southern France. But a special interest attaches to the <em>Charles
Quint</em> on its present voyage. She is bound for the wars, and
the passengers she carries are, in many instances, leaving their
native country for the first time in order to take part in a
campaign in which the full amount<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_20">[20]</span> of peril must be encountered. What a mixed
and picturesque company we have on board the ship! There are a
number of unmistakable Algerian colonists, male and female, stout
in figure and swart of complexion, returning to their homes on the
other side of the Mediterranean. We talk of the French faculty of
dressing. I wonder how long it would take for England to produce,
among the respectable middle classes, such a picture of unkempt
dowdiness as that which is presented by one of our passengers, the
only lady apparently who has secured a place in the first saloon.
Next to the Algerians, who have been kissing, laughing, crying, and
shouting for the last hour, as one by one they parted from their
friends, we have a number of commercial travellers; smart fellows,
who “know their way about,” and who are already beginning to make
themselves as comfortable as possible during their sojourn on board
ship.</p>

<p>But it is in the people who are actually bound for Tunis and the
war that I am chiefly interested. We have about a score of officers
on board, chiefly doctors and captains of infantry. Poor fellows!
They pace up and down the deck with rather melancholy<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span> faces, casting many a longing
eye towards the white houses and white hills of Marseilles. Nobody
has come to see them off. Nobody seems inclined to take much notice
of them. I should certainly not gather from the manner in which
they are regarded by the outer world that the war is very popular
in Marseilles. Nor does the army seem to occupy a very brilliant
social position in the estimation of the French people. Will it be
believed that no officer under the rank of a major is permitted to
travel first class on these boats? So our rueful-visaged captains
troop off presently with clanking swords and downcast heads, to
take their appointed places in the second saloon.</p>

<p>But who is this that suddenly appears upon the hurricane-deck—a
vision, well, hardly of beauty or of joy, but still of a very
uncommon kind? Five-and-twenty years ago, at the time when
illustrated histories of the Crimean war were common, and when my
young imagination was being fed upon the stirring adventures of the
French and English allies under the walls of Sebastopol, I was
quite familiar with such a figure as this, for it was one which was
constantly appearing in the pages of the aforesaid illustrated
histories.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span> But I had
almost forgotten that such beings had ever existed until this
moment, when a real live Vivandière, clad in her full uniform, with
plumed hat, frock coat, military trousers, and shining boots
complete, stepped upon the hurricane-deck and saluted me with bland
dignity. She must be no ordinary vivandière either, for on her
breast glitters a row of medals, crosses, and decorations of all
kinds, that would do credit to a prize ox at Smithfield, whilst
round her neck is a red ribbon, which must surely be that of the
Legion of Honour. Nor are these the only distinguishing marks she
bears. On her arm is a broad band of canvas, bearing the sign of
the Red Cross. So my vivandière is not going to Tunis to sell wine,
but to succour the wounded. I think of one of Ouida’s novels, and
cry to myself, “Brava, Cigarette!” though all the time I wonder to
what extent the Arabs are likely to respect that Red Cross. She is
a brisk, comely woman of forty or thereabouts, with a sharp, shrewd
eye, a pleasant smile, and a ready jest for everybody. In less than
five minutes after her appearance on board she has made friends
with some of her fellow-passengers,<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_23">[23]</span> and is volubly explaining to them the mission
on which she is proceeding to Africa.</p>

<p>At five o’clock sharp the last bell rings, and the visitors
leave the ship and range themselves alongside the dock wall. I
lounge over the rail of the upper deck, smoking my cigarette, and
watching a dozen little dramas of domestic life that are being
played out under my eyes. Wives, some tearful and others gay, are
parting from their husbands. Alas! for the “contrariness” of human
nature. In my cynical mood this afternoon I cannot but observe that
where the wives are in tears the husbands are all smiles and jokes;
whilst a blithe face on the part of a wife means a grim and
melancholy countenance on the part of her spouse. But at last the
welcome sound of the screw puts an end to my observations. The
stately ship begins slowly to glide out of the basin, and ten
minutes later we are fairly clear of the port of Marseilles, whose
white towers and rocks and hills begin slowly to fade away as the
<em>Charles Quint</em> ploughs her path onward through the blue
waters of the Gulf of Lyons. As one turns seaward towards the
Mediterranean it is impossible to forget that twelve<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span> months ago to-day I was sailing
on this same sea, in the company of as joyous and genial a little
band of travellers as ever traversed the ocean. Alas! of that small
company two of the bravest and the best have already reached the
end of the long voyage of life; whilst the others are scattered far
and wide all up and down the world; and I am here alone to-day, the
solitary Englishman on board this vessel. As I sat after dinner
smoking a last cigar on a comfortable deckseat, and watching the
stars blaze out in their southern magnificence, whilst the ear was
soothed by the solemn melody of the ocean, it was a difficult
matter to drive away those pensive feelings which must come to all
men when they revisit scenes once familiar to them, and reflect
upon the changes which have been wrought since they last were here.
But even whilst I mused I was suddenly aroused by a very trifling
yet significant incident. My cigar dropped out of my nerveless
hand, and I started up shivering, to find I had fallen asleep on
the open deck. Then I recalled the fact that I had not been in bed
last night, and made haste to turn into my comfortable cabin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span><em>Saturday,
October 15th.</em>—I awoke refreshed after a good night’s rest.
Presently turning out upon the deck, I found that I was in the full
enjoyment of real Mediterranean weather. The sun was bright and
hot, and one was glad to get shelter from it beneath the awning,
where the pleasant breeze produced by the rapid motion of the boat
made the temperature quite agreeable. The water was of that
wonderful blue colour which you see nowhere except in the
Mediterranean; but the waves were crested with white, and made the
blank sea, upon which not a sail was to be discovered, itself a
glorious spectacle. As I sat in the full enjoyment of the scene I
could not help thinking of last Saturday, and contrasting my
surroundings then, when I found myself one of thirty thousand human
beings packed into the Leeds Cloth Hall yard—or rather, into the
fine “Gladstone Hall” erected on that spot—with the situation in
which I am placed to-day.</p>

<p>I have already discovered that there is one serious defect about
the arrangements on board the <em>Charles Quint</em>. Everybody who
has travelled by sea knows that the two principal occupations of
well-disposed passengers<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_26">[26]</span> are eating the meals provided on board and
then grumbling at the cookery and the quality of the provisions
served. With a perverse want of consideration for the passengers,
the Compagnie Transatlantique have resolved apparently to deprive
them of at least one of these occupations—and possibly the
favourite one—that of grumbling. Nothing could well be better than
the manner in which we are fed on board the <em>Charles Quint</em>.
At seven in the morning the usual French “first breakfast,”
consisting of coffee and bread and butter, is provided. After that
I have my bath, and my first walk on deck. At half-past nine comes
the regular breakfast, beautifully served in the saloon. At the
head of our table sits the captain, a handsome and refined-looking
man of fifty, who speaks French with a strong southern accent, and
who is quite a model of mingled dignity and suavity. To his right
and left are seated two smart young gentlemen in elegant uniforms,
one of whom is the purser and the other the doctor, and whom I have
already christened the Corsican Brothers, not merely because of
their striking resemblance to each other, but because they
invariably<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span> walk the
deck together, and seem almost as inseparable as the Siamese Twins
themselves. Then, each of us in a comfortable revolving arm-chair,
come the ten or twelve saloon passengers.</p>

<p>A very sociable party we make; and how we enjoy our food, to be
sure! At breakfast this morning the following was the
<em>menu</em>, all the dishes being served in a style which would
have done credit to Champeau’s:—Radishes, anchovies (excellent),
omelette of mushrooms, calves’ head, hot lobster with sauce
piquante (excellent), filet de bœuf with potatoes, cheese, and
fruit. Admirable white and red wine is supplied in abundance during
the meal, and the usual coffee and cognac afterwards. With a
<em>cuisine</em> like this, and in so pleasant and airy a saloon as
ours, the most squeamish of travellers might fairly tempt the
“dangers of the deep.”</p>

<p>A very amusing conversation occupied the company at breakfast.
They thought proper to engage in an edifying discussion on
sea-sickness, accompanied by realistic—indeed, occasionally
<em>too</em> realistic—illustrations on the part of most present of
the peculiar manner in which they were affected by the<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span> malady. Eventually some one
propounded a knotty problem for solution. “How is it,” he asked,
“that Englishmen are never sea-sick?” Alas! poor innocent. I
thought of the revelation that awaited him whenever he made his
first passage from Calais to Dover; but in the meantime I listened
eagerly for the answer to his question. It came from the captain,
and was as follows: “You see it is all an affair of the
imagination, this sea-sickness. Now, the English have no
imagination, and consequently they are never sea-sick. <em>Voilà
tout!</em>”</p>

<p>But if my friends on board have limited ideas on some subjects,
they are nevertheless—like most people in this world when you once
get to know them—very good fellows, and they have shown an amazing
amount of kindness to myself as the sole foreigner on board. One
pleasant little “commercial,” bound for Bone, has insisted upon
playing chess with me during the greater part of the afternoon;
whilst after dinner the Corsican Brothers invited me to join them
in the smoking-room at a game at dummy whist. There was a lovely
sunset this evening, and to-night the stars are shining with
marvellous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
brilliance, the Milky Way reflecting a perceptible track of light
upon the ocean. The moon is burning, a crescent of red fire, high
in the heavens. Before turning in for the night the long low line
of the African coast became visible in the distance. Strangely
enough, I last saw it on this very day twelve months ago.</p>

<p><em>Sunday, October 16th.</em>—Hardly had I fallen into my first
sleep last night when I was aroused by the din of our arrival at
Bone. Everybody on board the ship apparently seemed to think it
necessary to jump out of bed and forthwith to make the greatest
possible amount of noise. Shouting, laughing, crying, talking, and
even playing the piano in the saloon, they evidently found that in
no other way could they give expression to their feelings at having
once more come within sight of land. One would have imagined that
it was a voyage of a year instead of one of a day only that had
come to an end. Then the “horrid winch” began to work, and for a
couple of hours the uproar was really appalling. After that,
apparently because everybody was exhausted, things became quieter,
and I was able to get a few hours’ sleep.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>At seven o’clock,
when I rose and dressed, I found the vessel moored alongside the
quay of Bone, and consequently lying snugly in the best harbour on
the coast of Algiers. Bone is one of the most flourishing towns in
the French colony in North Africa, and it attracts a considerable
number of commercial travellers like those who have come with me in
the <em>Charles Quint</em>. For the uncommercial traveller it has
other attractions of a special kind. Thus the sportsman comes here
because the railway from this place takes him to the nearest spot
to England where that noblest of all the beasts of the forest, the
lion, is to be found; whilst those who are interested in the past
visit Bone because here St. Augustine lived and wrote his burning
“Confessions,” and because near here his tomb is now to be
seen.</p>

<p>The morning was bright and beautiful, though on the brown hills
behind the town some rather ominous clouds were hanging. As I was
about to take my first walk on the soil of Africa, I thought it
advisable to array myself in my lightest attire, and accordingly I
presently sallied forth in a guise which would have brought a mob
to my heels in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span> any
English town. The scene was very picturesque. The town is of
semi-French architecture, with a wide boulevard and a little
square, besides many narrow streets. Everywhere Arabs, clad in the
flowing white <em>burnous</em> and in the blue or red
<em>jebbas</em>, were to be seen. Hundreds of black and brown
children—genuine street Arabs these—were gambolling about the doors
of the houses; and amid the swarthy elders of the famous race and
their half-naked offspring, there strolled about, with that air of
dignity which the conqueror, wherever he may be found, seldom
forgets to wear, numbers of Frenchmen.</p>

<p>Sunday morning though it was, the shops were all open. Those
best worth examining were the photograph and coral shops. Coral is
obtained in large quantities upon this coast; La Calle, a port a
few miles to the east, being one of the seats of the coral fishery.
The articles I was shown in the different shops were very cheap,
but were poor in quality. I strolled into the fish and vegetable
markets. In the former were many curious fishes, as well as some
very fine ones. Among the curious fish were large quantities of a
creature very like the octopus, which I<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_32">[32]</span> was told was a favourite delicacy among all
classes. In the vegetable market, besides an abundant supply of
such vegetables as are only produced in England during the summer,
there were great quantities of melons, oranges, lemons, and
pomegranates. In the centre of the town is a small garden, in which
tropical plants and trees were growing luxuriantly. Everywhere one
could see traces of the struggle between the old and the new, and
everywhere proofs were to be found of the success with which the
French are establishing their own institutions on the soil of
Africa, in spite of the dogged opposition of one of the most
conservative races in the world.</p>

<p>The church bells were ringing, and I could not resist the
temptation to attend the Catholic service in the town in which St.
Augustine once ministered. In coming back towards the ship, I
noticed that in many cases a bottle of live leeches was suspended
as a sign in front of the barbers’ shops. In an evil moment I was
induced to enter one of these establishments, and trust myself to
the tender mercies of an Algerian hairdresser. It was a wonderful
operation which I had to<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_33">[33]</span> undergo. I had chosen the most fashionable
establishment of the kind in Bone, and a stately Frenchwoman,
seated at that little counter which is so dear to the ladies of her
race, superintended the work of the shop, and received with dignity
the fees of the shorn. The barber to whose care I was intrusted
began by covering my head and beard with violet powder, causing me
to look amazingly like an overgrown baby. This was not the worst of
what I had to submit to, however, for when the hair-cutting was
concluded, my tormentor produced an article, the sight of which
recalled my own nursery days, to wit, a small tooth comb, and
proceeded to apply it with exemplary diligence to my head! It was
not without a feeling of profound thankfulness that I at last
escaped from his grasp, and, returning to the <em>Charles
Quint</em>, partook of the admirable breakfast which the
<em>chef</em> had served up. This breakfast began with oysters and
melons—which might have grown among the fields of far-away
Cassaba—and ended with new oranges and curaçao.</p>

<p>All the saloon passengers who came with me from Marseilles have
left the ship, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span> we
have some new-comers in their place. The most important of these is
Colonel Allegro, the notorious adventurer, who for a time filled
the post of Tunisian Consul at Bone, and who, although in the
service of the Bey, is well known as one of the most determined and
relentless Arab-hunters in North Africa. He is now on his way to
Tunis accompanied by Arab horses, Arab servants, and an immense
amount of camp equipments, having just been offered the command of
the cavalry in one of the columns which are destined to march upon
Kairwan. A swarthy man with keen black eyes and resolute mouth, the
colonel does not promise much in the way of agreeable companionship
during our voyage to Tunis. The other new-comers are a young
Italian with his remarkably pretty wife and their baby. This
gentleman lives at Susa, one of the Arab coast-towns in the Gulf of
Hammamet, and is returning to his dreary home after a pleasure-trip
to Paris. His wife seems quite content at the prospect of
exchanging the delights of Paris for the dull confinement of a
house in such a place as Susa. The husband has already taken me
into his confidence so far as to express his<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_35">[35]</span> opinion not only about Colonel Allegro in
particular, but about the French in general. There is clearly no
love lost between Frenchmen and Italians at this moment.</p>

<p>Whilst we have been waiting here discharging or taking in cargo,
my fair friend the vivandière has been distinguishing herself.
Yesterday, smooth though the sea was, she kept her berth, and
doubtless nourished those feelings towards the rest of the human
race which only the sea-sick know. To-day she had recovered her
equanimity, her good looks, and, I hope, her benevolence. At all
events, she stepped ashore early this morning arrayed in her most
gorgeous costume, feathers flying from her hat, and stars and
medals glittering on her bosom. A crowd of a hundred solemn-faced
Arabs, among whom a few lively-looking Frenchmen were mingled,
quickly formed round her, and escorted by this guard of honour she
set off into the town. She returned at twelve o’clock in the
highest state of delight. Her guard had increased from one to five
hundred, whilst she enjoyed the satisfaction of being tenderly
supported on either side by a private soldier of the line. I must
say these soldiers looked<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_36">[36]</span> rather sheepish, half proud and half ashamed,
in fact. Not so mademoiselle, however. It was evidently one of the
brightest moments of her life. She embraced her two friends with
fervour on parting from them; and then, leaning over the bulwarks
of the <em>Charles Quint</em>, she discharged a whole armoury of
messages of remembrance and affection to her brave comrades of the
91st regiment. How the Arabs stared; and how the jolly
handsome-looking young negroes on the quay showed their gleaming
white teeth as they grinned at the amazing spectacle.</p>

<p>They had something else to grin at presently. A shuffling young
fellow, aged twenty or thereabouts, in the red breeches and blue
coat of the infantry, came listlessly along in the direction of our
vessel. As soon as she saw him our vivandière became greatly
excited. “Ho! Adolphe! Adolphe! Venez ici!” she shouted at the top
of her somewhat shrill voice. Adolphe seemed not particularly
anxious to respond to the invitation. He grinned idiotically;
thrust his hands deeper than ever into his breeches’ pockets, and
blushed vividly. But he made no motion towards the gangway
connecting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span> the ship
with the shore. For a moment mademoiselle seemed puzzled as to what
she should do: then, after telling him that he was nothing but a
great stupid, she tripped lightly down the ladder, sprang upon the
quay, seized Adolphe’s ear between her dainty little finger and
thumb, and amidst the loud laughter of the spectators conducted him
in triumph on board the <em>Charles Quint</em>. Why she wanted him
there goodness only knows. Perhaps to scold, perhaps to pet him. I
do not know. But in a couple of minutes she reappeared with her
captive at the gangway, bestowed upon him two sounding kisses, and
then patting him on the back, sent him down the ladder looking more
doltish than ever. I think she must have seen a suspicious twinkle
in my eye. At all events she turned to me, and with a mocking
little curtsey said, “<em>C’est mon cousin, monsieur!</em>” But I
confess I have my own ideas about that kind of cousinship.</p>

<p class="sch word-spaced02"><span class="letter-spaced02">A WHITE
SQUAL</span>L.</p>

<p class="csum">A crowded deck — Rough seas — La Calle and its
boatmen — A sea-fight on a small scale — Dinner under difficulties
— Trying to sleep — The small miseries of life — The Gulf of Tunis
— A beautiful prospect — Goletta — My friend Afrigan — Jewish women
— French soldiers.</p>

<p><em>Sunday, October 16th.</em>—The <em>Charles Quint</em> left
Bone at two o’clock on its voyage to Goletta. Unfortunately, before
the hour of sailing the weather underwent a complete change. Heavy
clouds settled down upon the hills encircling the town, swathing
them in a grey mist, so that the scenery suddenly seemed to change
from that of Africa to that of Scotland. Indeed, these African
hills at all times bear a strong resemblance to the brown highlands
of our own country. Then a fresh wind sprang up, and sharp showers
of rain began to fall; whilst the sea rapidly lost its beautiful
blue colour, and turned to a pale green like that of the German
Ocean. I was glad to betake myself to my cabin, and there lay aside
the white garments in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
which I had clad myself in the hot early morning, returning to a
warmer and more sober dress.</p>

<p>At last, at two o’clock, the moorings were cast loose, and we
set sail amid the chattering of the excited crowd of Moors and
negroes on the wharf, and the dismal groaning of our deck
passengers, whose prophetic souls had apparently already enabled
them to foresee the trouble that was to come. It is one
characteristic of French and Italian steamers, and not altogether
an agreeable one, that the whole deck is free to the passengers of
all classes. The saloon is, of course, reserved for those who pay
for its accommodation: but everybody is at liberty to walk upon the
hurricane-deck, or to sit in the snug corners which abound near the
poop. This afternoon accordingly I found many Arabs, many Jews, and
not a few dubious-looking Christians, scattered about on the upper
deck. Below, in the ship’s waist, were the horses and tents of
Colonel Allegro, and a swarm of Mohammedan women squatting under
Turkish carpets, and apparently endeavouring to persuade themselves
that they were going to have a fine run to<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_40">[40]</span> La Calle, the first port on the way to
Goletta. Alas! no sooner had we got clear of the harbour of Bone
than we found ourselves in the full enjoyment of all the
experiences of a white squall. Only a few hours had been needed to
turn the placid sea of yesterday into a boiling, angry ocean, upon
which our brave <em>Charles Quint</em> pitched and rolled like a
cork. Woeful was then the scene among our deck passengers. One
after another they succumbed to their inevitable fate, and before
long there did not seem to be a single person among them who was
not horribly sick.</p>

<p>The misfortune was that they simply “lay where they fell” like
so many logs, so that a promenade upon the upper deck could only be
enjoyed at the risk of trampling upon some prostrate Arab, Turk, or
Jew. I thought of Thackeray’s description of “the white squall
famous” which he encountered nearly forty years ago in the Levant.
Many of his lines were appropriate to the situation on board the
<em>Charles Quint</em> as, tossed about upon the raging sea, she
resolutely fought her way onwards towards her destination:—</p>

<div class="line indent0">And they knelt and moan’d and

<div class="line indent0">And they crawl from bales and

<div class="line indent0">In a hundred thousand stenches.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="nind">For Greeks read Algerians—and really I hardly think
it is necessary to change the<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_42">[42]</span> word—and one has a very fair picture in
Thackeray’s delightful doggerel of the white squall of this
afternoon.</p>

<p>Two hours after leaving Bone we reached La Calle, a small,
desolate-looking town pitched at the bottom of a deep bay, and,
like all these North African ports, surrounded by an amphitheatre
of brown hills. La Calle is famous as one of the great seats of the
coral fishery, and this fishery is carried on by a colony of
Italians. Unfortunately for the comfort of persons wishing to visit
La Calle, these Italians are employed to convey passengers from the
steamer to the tiny little harbour, and this afternoon they gave us
a “taste of their quality” which was worthy of the very worst days
of the Sicilian and Neapolitan banditti. The sea was running, I
won’t say mountains, but certainly hillocks, high, and the
steamboat was rolling incessantly. Under the best of circumstances
the transfer of the passengers from the vessel to small boats must
therefore have been a work of considerable risk. Indeed, at one
moment you saw a little cockle-shell of a boat waiting to convey
passengers twenty feet off in the trough of the sea, and the next
instant it was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span> being
jammed against the ladder which the trembling voyagers had to
descend. But to add to the ordinary perils of transhipment under
such conditions, the worthy coral-fishers of La Calle, who I am
convinced had left their country for their country’s good, engaged
in the fiercest struggle over each hapless passenger as he got to
the foot of the ladder. They shrieked and swore and tore their
hair; they uttered blasphemies so foul and horrible that one was
thankful that their language was to a great extent unintelligible;
they aimed furious blows at each other with oars and boat-hooks,
and thought nothing of endeavouring to stave in the side of a rival
boat, though they must have known that its occupants would
assuredly have been drowned if they had succeeded. It was a naval
battle on a small scale, and I confess that as I looked at it, as I
saw these frail little craft tossed to and fro by the boiling sea,
and beheld their owners, apparently possessed by the most maniacal
fury, striking and cutting and cursing at each other, regardless of
imminent danger to themselves, I became as much absorbed in the
spectacle as though I were looking on at a new Trafalgar.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>But when the
unfortunate passengers, trembling girls and women, and men who
seemed to share their terrors, became involved in the struggle,
rage and indignation came uppermost in my breast, and I was
strongly tempted to try whether the sight of a revolver might not
have reduced these ruffians to some degree of quietude. It was
really piteous to see one poor woman, evidently in a very delicate
state of health, and perfectly livid with terror, led down the
heaving ladder. In the extremity of her alarm she implored us all,
as we were Christians, to let her die in peace on board the
steamer. She had been exceedingly sick on the passage from Bone,
and one would have thought she would have hailed the prospect of
reaching land with delight. But the horrors of that middle passage
from the ship to the shore were too much for her. And then as she
clung convulsively to her husband and a stout sailor on the
slippery plank at the foot of the ladder which the waves every
moment threatened to submerge, the ruffians in the boats made
straight for her, and literally endeavoured to tear her from her
husband’s grasp. At each<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_45">[45]</span> moment I expected to see the whole group fall
into the sea; but at last the poor creature was flung, almost
senseless from fright, into the bottom of one of the boats, her
baby was tossed in after her as though it had been a bundle, and
the husband, after finding himself buried to his waist in a green
sea which suddenly swept up the side of the <em>Charles Quint</em>,
was permitted to join them. So the work went on for an hour or
more, forming one of the most painful and exciting spectacles I
ever beheld. I am not particularly timid about matters of this
sort; but I confess I would not have landed at La Calle this
afternoon under any pressure short of that of absolute necessity.
Many persons are drowned every year on this coast in the attempt to
land, much of the risk and consequent loss of life arising from the
atrocious misbehaviour of the boatmen.</p>

<p>At last, when the shades of night were closing in, we turned our
backs upon La Calle, and once more made direct for the Gulf of
Tunis. By this time we were in something more than a mere squall.
The wind was blowing strong from the south-west, and the sea was
following the big<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
steamer in huge green waves which seemed trying to catch and
overwhelm us. How we pitched and rolled, and staggered and tossed
and thumped along! The dinner-bell rang, and I turned into the
saloon. Of course the “fiddles” were on the table; but even those
detestable instruments did not prevent half my soup being emptied
into my waistcoat, or a bottle of Bordeaux from pouring in a
crimson tide over the tablecloth. Colonel Allegro was the only
passenger who joined me at the meal; and it was eaten under
difficulties of no ordinary kind. At one moment the colonel seemed
to be lying on his back immediately below me, whilst plates,
knives, forks, and glasses all appeared to be slipping towards him,
with intent to disappear in his huge open mouth; at the next he was
glaring down upon me from an inaccessible height, from which he was
discharging at my devoted head the crockery and cutlery he had just
been upon the point of swallowing.</p>

<p>Of course, we laughed and joked and made the best of it; but
really the greatest joke of all was the attempt to eat under such
circumstances. I was not surprised when my good friends, the
Corsican Brothers, rose solemnly<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_47">[47]</span> from their chairs, held on hard whilst they
made polite bows to myself and the colonel, and then staggered away
with interlocked arms and white faces into the darkness of the
deck. Even the captain looked uncomfortable, and, for my part, I
frankly confess that I should at that moment have preferred the
humblest fare upon a plain deal board on solid earth to the most
sumptuous repast that could have been served on this table that was
behaving itself like a rocking-horse bewitched. With profound
thankfulness I drank my coffee and cognac, and recognized the fact
that dinner was over. I tried to smoke on deck, but soon found that
it would be necessary to be lashed to one’s seat in order to be
secure; so I gave up the attempt and turned into my berth. Even
here it was with the greatest difficulty that I could keep myself
inside the berth, the ship rolling so violently that more than once
I was flung out upon the floor of the cabin, much after the fashion
in which a sack of coals is discharged from a cart. I picked myself
up, bruised and sore, and tried to sleep. But the screams of the
frightened passengers all around me, the crash of falling boxes,
and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span> the thunder of
the waves as they washed over the deck, made slumber impossible. So
about eleven o’clock I made my way as best I could upon deck once
more.</p>

<p>It was a magnificent sight which met my eyes, as I clung to the
hand-rail of the hurricane-deck and peered out into the gloomy
night. Heavy black clouds were flitting rapidly across the sky, the
phosphorescent sea was boiling brilliantly on every side of the
<em>Charles Quint</em>; on the starboard the long line of the coast
could be seen, and through the heaving waves our noble ship went
staggering along after the fashion of a Dover and Calais packet,
whilst its progress was accompanied by the discordant shrieking of
the wind in the cordage overhead. It was when I had finally turned
in for the night, after giving a reassuring answer to an
unfortunate fellow-passenger, who was convinced that all hope of
our ever touching land again was gone, that I had occasion to
undergo an experience which might furnish a theme for an admirable
discourse. I had foolishly placed my watch under my pillow, and in
one of my struggles to retain my place in my berth I broke the
glass. It was a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span> very
small matter, but it is the small miseries of life that are the
worst to bear; and I confess I was in no philosophic temper as,
holding on like grim death to the side-board of my berth with one
hand, I scraped up the broken fragments of glass as best I could
with the other, and endeavoured to make it possible for me to get
into bed again in safety.</p>

<p><em>Monday, October 17th.</em>—After the storm a calm! When I
awoke this morning, about seven o’clock, the brilliant sunshine was
streaming in at my port, and all was perfectly still and silent in
my cabin. It was difficult to realize the fact that this sedate
little chamber had been going through all the antics which had
tormented me a few hours earlier; but alas! there was evidence of
the truth in the state of the floor, upon which the contents of one
of my portmanteaus had been scattered in a promiscuous fashion. I
did not lose much time in turning out, and then, indeed, I beheld a
sight which more than repaid me for anything I had suffered on the
previous day. The ship was at anchor in the Bay of Tunis. Do you
ask me to describe the Bay of Tunis? Pray have you ever<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span> read a description of the Bay of
Naples, or the Bosphorus, or the Gulf of Smyrna? No words can do
justice to the exquisite scene that presented itself as I stepped
upon deck this morning. The great bay is almost land-locked. To the
east is a fine range of billowy hills, called the Lead Mountains,
famous both for their mineral treasures and their hot springs. In
the dim distance the blue peaks of the Zaghouan range were to be
descried, the range of mountains that look down upon the far-famed
city of Kairwan. Directly in front of me were the white houses of
Goletta, among which the curious water-palace of the Bey, built
upon piles and standing out into the waves, was conspicuous. Away
to the west was the stony amphitheatre, rich with the memories of
two thousand years, where once stood Carthage, the very spot from
which Dido looked with longing eyes upon the white sails of her
hero-lover as they floated over this lovely bay; and beyond
Carthage, with its great College of St. Louis now dominating the
spot, was the lofty peak on the edge of which is built the walled
Arab town of Sidi bou Said. Everywhere there were fine hills in
graceful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span> outline
sweeping down to the fresh blue waters of the Gulf, and everywhere
there were strange tropical trees, lofty date-palms and straggling
prickly pears, to remind me that I was no longer in Europe; whilst
at every point white-walled towns and rambling palaces or
fortresses met the eye. And then for our foreground we had the bay
with its crowd of shipping, among which was one beautiful craft,
the <em>Bittern</em>, from which floated the English flag. It was a
lovely and refreshing scene, and as I drank in all its details with
eager eye I felt thankful that I had not allowed myself to be
deterred from coming here by any of the exaggerated tales of
dangers and horrors which I had heard at home or on my way
hither.</p>

<p>Small boats of curious Eastern shape and rig, manned by Arabs,
negroes, or Maltese, were dancing along over the sparkling sea.
There was much coming and going, too, of heavy barges between the
shore and the huge French transports which were lying in a line not
far from our own gunboat the <em>Bittern</em>. Evidently great
quantities of military stores are being unshipped for the use of
the army. After a little delay one of<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_52">[52]</span> the smaller boats came alongside the
<em>Charles Quint</em>. I shook hands with the captain and the
Corsican Brothers, who had now quite recovered their equanimity and
good looks, and started for the shore. What was I to find there?
Endless had been the stories of the perils to be encountered in
Tunis which had been dinned into my ears during the journey out.
But I had found that the nearer I drew to Tunis the less terrible
those stories became, and though I had taken the precaution to load
my revolver before seating myself in the boat, I had a firm
conviction that I should find Tunis, upon the whole, at least as
safe a place of residence as some portions of her Majesty’s
dominions are at this moment.</p>

<p>The little harbour of Goletta—<em>the</em> Goletta, as it is
universally called here—is guarded by a curious breakwater of
time-worn stones. This breakwater is said, like the quaint Custom
House which stands at one end of it, to have been constructed by
the Spaniards of stone taken from the ruins of Carthage. Beyond the
breakwater you enter a kind of canal, on one side of which is the
crumbling fort of Goletta, which has more than once<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span> stood a prolonged siege, which,
indeed, had the honour upon one occasion to be assailed by no less
a personage than Charles the Fifth. As I was rowed up the canal,
under the walls of the fortress, dozens of Arab boys, playing on
the banks in their brilliant costumes, pointed with jeers and
laughter to the passing European; negroes, black as night, grinned
with placid good-humour at my pale face and curious dress; whilst
now and then a sullen Moor, wrapped in the graceful folds of his
<em>burnous</em>, shot forth a glance full of anger and contempt.
Here at least I could feel that I had got beyond the reach of Mr.
Cook and his “personally-conducted” flock, and that whatever
experiences might await me, they would not be commonplace.</p>

<p>And yet my first experience of all upon landing was as
commonplace as could be wished. I had hardly jumped ashore, at the
foot of the shady main street of Goletta, when a swarthy young man
approached me, and, lifting his hat, announced himself as the
commissionaire of the Grand Hotel of Tunis! I might have been
leaving a train at the Hague or Cologne. Yet let me confess that
this interruption to my<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_54">[54]</span> dream of Eastern adventures, though
unromantic, was not unwelcome. Very quickly I placed myself in the
hands of my new friend, Afrigan by name, who appeared to be an
unusually intelligent and gentlemanly specimen of the order to
which he belonged. [And here to anticipate the record of my diary,
I cannot do better than state that Afrigan remained with me as
servant and interpreter during the whole of my stay in the Regency,
and that from first to last I found him most useful and trustworthy
in both capacities. His honesty, good-nature, and intelligence, his
remarkable knowledge of the current languages of Northern Africa,
and his steadfast devotion to my interests, made him invaluable to
me. I shall have many subsequent occasions to mention him in the
course of my story; but it is only right that I should make this
statement regarding him at this point in the narrative.] Under his
care I first visited the Custom House. A very good-natured,
gentlemanly Arab passed my portmanteaus through without troubling
himself to look at their contents; and they were forthwith taken up
to the little railway station and deposited there.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>It wanted an hour
and a half to the time for the starting of the train for Tunis, so
not to lose one’s opportunities I set off, accompanied by Afrigan,
for a walk through Goletta. The town consists of one short but wide
main street, with shady trees growing down either side, and a
number of wretched, winding alleys, opening into miserable unpaved
squares. Everywhere there was plenty of life and activity. French
officers in crowds were sitting drinking and smoking under the
trees in front of the two cafés of which the place can boast,
whilst all about were troops of Arabs and Jews, dressed in all the
colours of the rainbow. One of the first things to strike my
attention was the extraordinary costume of the Jewish women—a
costume quite unlike anything I had seen before, either in Eastern
Europe or Asia Minor. It consists of a short silk jacket and white
tights, the latter displaying the shape of the limbs to advantage.
In many cases these tight trousers were embroidered in gold or
silver, and I am told that sometimes a pair will cost as much as
twenty pounds sterling. The Arab women wear a somewhat similar
dress; but the “cut” is by no means so<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_56">[56]</span> smart as it is in the case of the Jewesses;
whilst they have in addition a large burnous enveloping them almost
down to the heels, and in all cases their faces are hidden by thick
black yashmaks, the effect of which is hideous in the extreme. The
Jewish women wear either a coloured silk handkerchief gracefully
folded in turban fashion on their heads, or a white cap with
projecting horns, somewhat after the style of the head-dress of the
girls of Northern Holland. What the Arab women look like I cannot,
of course, say; but many of the Jewesses are really handsome—a fact
of which they are by no means ignorant. Most of the Arab men whom I
have seen at Goletta are also very good-looking, stalwart
fellows.</p>

<p>As I sat sipping a cup of coffee in front of a café, large
numbers of French soldiers on fatigue duty passed me, whilst ever
and anon the echoes of the street were woke up by the rumble of a
military waggon or a heavy piece of ordnance. The soldiers, poor
fellows, are very young, and have a wearied and dispirited look.
Most of them were carrying burdens which seemed to overtax their

<p class="sch">A FIRST GLIMPSE OF TUNIS.</p>

<p><em>Monday, October 17th.</em>—A railway-station in Africa,
strange as it may seem to some persons, is not very much unlike a
railway-station anywhere else. Still it must be confessed that
there was a certain incongruousness between my surroundings in
Goletta—the picturesque Moors, Arabs, and negroes, who abounded in
all manner of quaint and startling costumes—and the high-roofed
shed of commonplace appearance from which the trains start for
Tunis. Half-past ten was the hour fixed for the departure of the
train, and shortly before that time, accompanied by Afrigan, I
strolled up to the station, took a first-class ticket at an
ordinary “pigeonhole” for myself and a third-class for
my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span> companion, and
then went to take my seat in the carriage.</p>

<p>My ticket, I observed, was printed in English, whereas Afrigan’s
was in Italian. At first I was disposed to attribute this
difference to the fact well known twenty years ago in Germany, that
only princes, Englishmen, and fools travelled first class. It
turned out, however, that these first-class tickets were a relic of
the time when this Goletta-Tunis railway was in the hands of an
English Company. They were, in fact, part of the stock handed over
when the Italians took possession of the line some years ago.
Clearly, there is no very great demand for first-class railway
accommodation in Northern Africa.</p>

<p>But as I was listening to this explanation on the station
platform, a welcome sound fell upon my ear. It was a sound
commonplace enough to stay-at-home people, but one which can never
become altogether commonplace to those who are in the habit of
travelling. In brief, it was the sound of the English language,
spoken by unmistakable Englishmen. Only two or three days had
passed since I had parted with a fellow-countryman at Marseilles;
but already I was prepared to welcome any chance Englishman whom
I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span> might meet as a
friend. The gentlemen whose voices attracted my notice at the
Goletta railway-station this morning were three in number. They had
already taken their seats in one of the shady compartments of the
train, and I at once joined them and introduced myself. One of them
was Captain P———, commanding the <em>Bittern</em> gunboat; another
was the unfortunate commander of the <em>Aristides</em>, an English
steamer which was wrecked two days ago near Bizerta, and the crew
of which had been rescued by the <em>Bittern</em> at some risk and
not a little trouble; whilst the third was an English gentleman
residing at Goletta and carrying on business at Tunis, Mr. P———.
The first demand of my new friends was for news from England. I
produced last week’s <em>Punch</em> and <em>World</em>, and the
<em>Standard</em> of Wednesday, and soon they were busily engaged
in mastering their contents. Then I remembered one little item of
news I had learned after leaving home, and told them of Parnell’s
arrest. “What! is he caught at last?” cried the captain of the
<em>Bittern</em>; “Hurrah!” and off went his hat in token of his
approval of the new departure in the policy of the Government. I
remembered how General A———<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_60">[60]</span> had thrown <em>his</em> hat up in the
courtyard of the Grand Hotel at Paris when I told him the same
piece of news, and smiled to myself at the evidence which was thus
afforded of the general agreement of Englishmen all over the world
upon that particular subject.</p>

<p>Outside the carriages on the railway, broad covered balconies
run, upon which in hot weather the passenger can stand and enjoy
the breeze, whilst he gets a full view of the country through which
the line passes. Taking advantage of this arrangement, I enjoyed my
short ride up to Tunis immensely. The day was exceedingly hot, but
here under the balcony-roof one was sheltered from the rays of the
sun. The line runs seemingly upon a dead level all the way from
Goletta to the capital. On one side of it is the lake called by the
natives El Bahira, or the Little Sea, which extends from Goletta
almost to the very walls of Tunis. It is said that this lake is now
little more than an enormous open cesspool, all the sewage of Tunis
being poured into it. This may be the case, but at least it has
this in common with some other unwholesome things, that it is very
fair to look upon. Nothing could be<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_61">[61]</span> more beautiful, indeed, than the aspect of
this broad sheet of water as the train rolled in leisurely fashion
past it this morning. Its waves were dancing and glittering in the
brilliant sunshine, and the colour of the cloudless blue sky was
reflected upon its surface. Little lateen-sailed fishing-boats were
gliding hither and thither, suggesting strongly by their peculiar
rig the pirate craft which in my earliest days I associated with
the Gulf of Tunis; a strong fort, said to be of Spanish origin,
stood out in the very middle of the lake, rising sheer from the
water, after the manner of the Castle of Chillon; on the bank
nearest to me the reeds grew in forests, enormous flocks of
flamingoes and herons rising from them and sailing lazily away as
the train passed; whilst on the further shore the waves broke
against a splendid range of brown hills and dark grey crags, save
where they seemed to wash against the gleaming white walls of Tunis
itself.</p>

<p>It was a new revelation of beauty to me; and I wondered for a
moment that in all that I had seen and read and heard of the
picturesque spots of Europe, I had remained ignorant of the
surpassing loveliness which<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_62">[62]</span> now gladdened my eye. But I turned to the
other side, and what I saw there served to remind me that I had
passed out of the European range and of the circuit of the ordinary
searchers after the picturesque. A vast yellow plain, on which not
a blade of grass seemed to grow, but which was broken here and
there by patches of olive-forest, the gnarled trunks and dull green
leaves only serving to deepen the general impression of arid
desolation which the plain produced: beyond the plain, ranges of
low hills, with now and then a palm-tree raising its feathery crown
against the deep, unbroken azure of the sky, and here and there a
white house standing in the midst of a thicket of prickly pear.
This was what I saw when I turned away from El Bahira, and looked
westwards. I had seen nothing like this before in any part of the
world. This yellow desert of sand, these groves of olives and palm,
these tangles of cactus and prickly pear, and that marvellous sky
with its infinite depth of blue, its fierce, relentless glare of
light and heat, belonged not to Europe, but to Africa. And to one
of the most famous parts of Africa withal; for this was
once<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span> the Plain of
Carthage, and the great city stretched hitherwards from the shore
of the Gulf, until it almost reached to Tunis itself.</p>

<p>Alongside the railway straggles the broad, sandy road from
Goletta and the Marsa to Tunis. There was no lack of life upon this
road this morning. Just outside Goletta a French camp is pitched,
and here some hundreds of soldiers were washing or cooking, or
trying to shelter themselves from the cruel sun. All round the camp
I noticed that sentries were placed at very short intervals, and
there were other indications of the fact that the French army finds
itself in an enemy’s country in Tunis. Then, when we got clear of
the camp and the soldiers, what an infinite number of picturesque
groups and “bits” that would have delighted an artist were
scattered along the road! Here was a train of camels plodding along
in that grave and clumsy fashion peculiar to their race. These
African camels are not to be compared in size or beauty—for,
strange as it may seem, even a camel can be beautiful—to those of
Asia. Nothing can exceed the awkwardness of their gait, unless it
be the stubbornness of their tempers. A “rogue” camel
is,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span> indeed, anything
but a pleasant customer to encounter in a narrow street. He has a
delightful habit of laying about him with his teeth after the
fashion of that legendary animal the American “snapping turtle,”
and with the most aristocratic unconsciousness of your presence he
will squeeze you flat against the wall by means of the enormous
boxes he carries slung like panniers over his back, and pass on
without so much as glancing round to see what mischief he has done.
But at a distance, and with this background of sandy plain, which
harmonizes so well with the colour of his own hide, he adds not a
little to the picturesqueness of the scene—especially when he is
attended by a jet-black negro from the Soudan, clad in the gay and
flaunting colours which are <em>de rigueur</em> in that quarter of
the world.</p>

<p>Then we passed a couple of Arabs in loose jebbas of dark-green
hue, bare legs, enormous turbans, and brilliant yellow slippers,
cantering gaily along towards Tunis on a pair of fine mules. Poor
mules! What a burden they had to bear. The lowest part of the load
seemed to consist of enormous sacks stuffed with grain of some
kind; then there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span> were
strings of pumpkins, nets filled with pomegranates, prickly pears,
and red gherkins, baskets of unripe dates or olives, and bottles of
oil dangling in a promiscuous way from all parts of the back;
whilst on the top of all sat the owner plying his stick with
vigour. The “seat” of an Arab on horse, mule, or donkey back, like
the ways of the Heathen Chinee, is peculiar. He sits sideways, not
as European ladies do with one leg drawn up in front of the other,
but with both legs dangling side by side, exactly as though the
animal he had mounted was a couch or a bench. The effect produced
by this lazy and ungraceful mode of riding is very ludicrous; but,
judging by all that I saw this morning, the seat is safe enough for
those who are accustomed to it.</p>

<p>A little crowd of tawny Bedouin children, almost naked, flying
across the plain towards the train, their black hair streaming
behind them, and the savage dogs of their camp barking ferociously
at their heels, came by way of welcome interlude to the long
procession of quadrupeds. Then at the foot of a splendid palm-tree
a group were seated, who looked as though they had
stepped<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span> straight out
of some picture of “The Repose in Egypt.” A woman with veiled
features and graceful form, a man of swarthy complexion and
splendid symmetry of figure, and a beautiful babe! A world-old
group this; but clad in these garments and in the midst of such a
scene, strangely suggestive of the family of Bethlehem. And there
were scantily clad Arabs ploughing in the fields behind two stout
heifers, their plough an instrument so primitive that it can hardly
have been changed in shape since the days when the towers of
Carthage dominated this same plain; and here and there a group of
women—all with yashmaks hiding their faces from the eyes of the
curious—were gathered round a well, in the midst of a little oasis
of acacia and prickly pear; and occasionally a heavily-laden,
roughly-built country cart trundled on towards the city, carrying
its burden of vegetables, or passed in the other direction laden
with bags of <em>couscousoo</em>, and gaily-coloured dishes and
vessels of native pottery; and once, a richly dressed Moor, on a
splendidly caparisoned Arab, which he rode in European fashion,
galloped past with a speed like that of the wind. And over all this
scene,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span> so strange in
all its details, so picturesque in its general effect, there was
the wonderful dome of cloudless blue sky, like the cupola of some
vast furnace.</p>

<p>A very brief run brought us up to the station within the walls
of Tunis. The throng of Arabs, Jews, and Jewesses, in their
many-hued dresses, poured out of the carriages of the train, and
passed from the shade of the station into the dazzling glare of the
sunshine beyond in a brilliant cascade of colour. I parted from my
new-found English friends, and set off with Afrigan to the hotel, a
stout negro porter carrying my portmanteaus, travelling-rugs, and
other <em>impedimenta</em> upon his back, in a fashion recalling
the hammals of Stamboul.</p>

<p>The first glimpse of Tunis from the railway station is somewhat
disappointing. The place looks too modern and too European for its
reputation. In front of the station there is a broad, unfinished
street, running down to the point at which it is intersected at
right angles by a shady boulevard, the Marina. There is little
about either the street in which the station stands or the Marina
to show that you have left Europe or Algeria behind
you.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span> Most of the
houses in these two streets are of a modified French or Italian
style of architecture; so that one wondered at the fact that this
was actually Tunis, the city where “the grateful Turk” of one’s
“Sandford and Merton” days was once Bey, where many another
legendary hero of my boyhood was once a captive, and where
Mussulman lust and cruelty, whether Turkish or Moorish, for
centuries indulged in orgies which make the name of the place still
infamous. I have already learned once more to correct my first
impressions, and have found that the real Tunis surpasses one’s
expectations so far as picturesqueness of appearance is concerned;
but it is worth putting on record for the benefit of future
travellers, the disappointment occasioned by my earliest glimpse at
the city.</p>

<p>The Grand Hotel, which is within three minutes’ walk of the
station, is a handsome new building, and, like all the other
buildings I have yet seen in Tunis, it is constructed of white
stone or stucco. Indeed, at the first glance this morning, I was
struck by the painful glare of white pervading the whole place.
White walls, white roads, even white trees, for the fine dust has
coated the trunks<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span> and
leaves thickly, make the outlook in all directions dazzling in the
extreme. A flag was flying from one of the windows of the hotel; a
couple of French sentries were walking up and down in front of it,
and French officers or orderlies were passing in and out of the
open door like bees round a hive. At a respectful distance a small
knot of Arabs were gathered, watching what was going on with sullen
faces; whilst additional liveliness was imparted to the scene by
the constant altercations between the sentries and a dozen
street-boys, in native costume, who seemed to have all the
impudence and a great deal more than the picturesqueness of the
city Arab of London. The French have now been installed in Tunis
for some days. They entered it at the earliest hour of dawn last
Tuesday morning, the inhabitants waking up to find themselves in
the power of a Christian host. Intense excitement and indignation
have since prevailed in the native quarters of the town, and
rumours of an impending rising are commonly current. Many of the
Europeans, I am told, live in a state of perpetual alarm; but
others have confidence in the power of the French to put down
any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span> attempt to
overpower the non-Mussulman population. The meaning of the
appearance of the sentries in front of the Grand Hotel is, that it
is the headquarters of General Japy, the French commander of the
city.</p>

<p>The room in which I soon found myself installed at the hotel was
big and airy, with tiled floor and walls of hard white cement. The
light was carefully excluded by means of heavy wooden shutters. I
ventured to brave the terrors of the sun, in order that I might see
rather more of my apartment than it was possible to do whilst these
shutters were closed. Perhaps I should have done better if I had
remained in ignorance of the things which were revealed to me in
the glare of the sunshine. Alas! my big, airy room was loaded with
filth. The red tiles of the floor were thickly coated with the
white dust of the broad road outside; whilst each particular corner
had its cobwebs, and its own especial rubbish heap of more or less
abominable dirt. However, a little of Mark Tapley’s philosophy
never comes amiss under circumstances like the present. Having come
to Tunis, it would be absurd to grumble because my bedroom is not
altogether to my liking. One must<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_71">[71]</span> rather remember that this Grand Hotel is
looked upon by the natives as a marvellous and bewildering
exemplification of the European’s love of luxury. I breakfasted
poorly, the chief portion of my meal being apparently a piece of
goat’s flesh, the flavour of which was decidedly “high;” and then I
went out with Afrigan for a walk through the bazaars.</p>

<p>The walk was a comparatively short one, but it sufficed to open
my eyes to the reality about Tunis, and dispelled any sense of
disappointment I had experienced on my first entrance into the
city. Leaving the Marina, I passed under a fine Moorish archway of
the familiar horse-shoe pattern, into a little square beyond. This
gateway, known as the Bab el Bahr, is of great antiquity, and on
either side of it are sculptured stones bearing long inscriptions
in Arabic; Afrigan, unfortunately, though he speaks Arabic “like a
native,” could not decipher these inscriptions. The miniature
square beyond it is the central point of the old European quarter.
On one side is the fine, massive building, with its immense
enclosed balcony, occupied by the English Consul-General, Mr.
Reade. It was a pleasant sight to see the English flag
waving<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span> above so many
strange and curious objects. A smaller house, separated from the
English Consulate by a narrow street, is the residence of the
German Consul, and I believe the Austrian Consul also has his
dwelling in the square. A couple of cafés, chiefly frequented by
fez-wearing Jews and Maltese; a station-house for the police,
whence every two hours issue, in Indian file, as melancholy a
string of soldiers as Falstaff himself ever beheld; and one or two
shops for the sale of groceries, &amp;c., over one of which I saw
the words “English stores,” complete the square. But the houses are
nothing compared to the people who swarm in this little open space.
What costumes, what complexions, what figures, what faces! No
kaleidoscope ever yet presented such a variety of forms and colours
as you may see here, whilst you sit under the shade of an awning in
front of one of the two miserable cafés. How I longed for the
pencil of an artist this morning, for it is only by the graphic
method that one can convey even the faintest idea of the
composition of the ever-dissolving groups that all day long fill
this little place of meeting. Very few women are to be met with in
the crowd, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span> of
these not one in twenty is in European costume, although, as I have
said, this is the centre of the European quarter. But the dresses
of the men are sufficiently picturesque to make up for the lack of
female costumes. The Italians and Maltese, who constitute the
greater part of the European element, wear the fez; but by far the
largest number of the people here are clad in the full Arab
costume, consisting of yellow slippers, a pair of baggy white
trousers reaching to the knees, a gay silk sash, a white shirt, a
jebba or burnous of coloured silk or wool, and a magnificent
turban. I can’t say that all the colours of the rainbow are
represented in these dresses; but at least we have blue and green
and red and yellow in profusion. Then the complexions! Here is a
handsome fellow who might pass for a somewhat swarthy Frenchman,
and next to him is a negro from the Soudan, with the jet black skin
and the characteristic features of his race. Between these extremes
one gets every intervening shade. Fine-looking men most of these
Arabs are; though here and there one meets with some beggar,
scarred and mutilated, hideous to behold, the mere sight of
whose<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span> ghastly
features sends a thrill of horror to one’s very heart.</p>

<p>I could have spent hours in the little square, but Afrigan urged
me forward, and I went up the narrow winding way leading to the
bazaars. This, as my companion informed me, was the “Grande Rue de
Tunis.” I thought last year, when I walked up the Grande Rue of
Pera, that I could never again expect to see so wretched a main
street in a capital. But the thoroughfare through which I passed
to-day is even more narrow, crooked, and wretched than the famous
street of Constantinople. It led me, however, very quickly into the
heart of the Arab quarter. At intervals the street was arched over,
the houses being built right across it, so that one had, as it
were, to pass through a succession of tunnels. At the top of the
long thoroughfare was a small open space, at one side of which was
the entrance to the chief mosque of Tunis. The door was jealously
closed. It had been shut since the entry of the French into the
city. No Christian or Jewish footstep has ever defiled even the
outer court of any mosque in Tunis; and to-day I have been warned
that it is not safe even to pause<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_75">[75]</span> near one of the mosques in the present
excited temper of the people. So I merely ventured upon a passing
glance at the flight of stairs leading up to the main entrance,
upon which half a dozen sullen Arabs, clad each in a thick white
burnous, were lounging in the sun.</p>

<p>It was delightful presently to plunge into the dim, cool arcades
of the bazaar. I entered by the bazaar of the perfumers, and on
both sides of me from the little open shops, similar in style to
those of Stamboul, though still smaller in size, there issued
scents more pungent than agreeable. The henna leaf, by means of
which the Arabs dye their finger and toenails a deep red, seems to
be one of the most important articles in this bazaar. It bears a
strong resemblance to the green tea leaf. Next to the perfumers
came the workers in leather, hundreds of them squatting in their
dark little caverns, busily working at the yellow leather slippers
universally worn, or smoking a tranquil cigarette, or reading some
quaint Arabic MS., probably an invoice or a letter of advice from
the interior. None of them tried to attract my attention; no one
sought to secure my custom. They looked up at the
unwonted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span> sight of my
European dress for a single moment, and then generally turned away
with something like contempt depicted upon their swarthy faces.</p>

<p>I must say that it takes the conceit out of an Englishman to
find himself alone in the midst of such a place as this. He has a
“creepy,” uncomfortable feeling concerning the necessity of his
being upon his best behaviour if he is to succeed in passing
unchallenged. Once somebody gently touched my arm. I looked round.
A hideous hag, with face only half hidden by her black yashmak,
implored my charity. I gave her a <em>caroub</em>, and did what I
could to conceal the shudder of disgust occasioned by her
appearance. Presently we came to a little open space, with arched
roof and heavy pillars, in the very middle of the bazaar. This was
formerly the slave-market. The slave-market of Tunis! It was here,
then, that “the grateful Turk” of “Sandford and Merton” discovered
his early benefactor languishing in chains and misery. Thousands
upon thousands of miserable Christians, captured by Turkish and
Moorish pirates, have been exposed here for sale, chained to these
pillars<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span> in this
dismal vaulted square. Men now living in Tunis can remember the
time when slaves were sold here; it was, indeed, the father, and
the predecessor of the present English Consul, the late Sir Thomas
Reade, who succeeded in putting an end to the abominable traffic. I
was glad to turn away from the bazaar, and to take a walk with
Afrigan through those higher and more aristocratic parts of Tunis
which are reserved for the native population, and in which no
Christian or European is allowed to dwell.</p>

<hr class="chap">

<h2><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span><a id=

<p class="sch">THE ENGLISH CONSULATE.</p>

<p class="csum">Mr. Reade — His appointment as Consul-General —
Changed circumstances — The Consul at home — Walls of blue china —
The Consul’s duties — An offensive globe-trotter — A drive round
the city walls — The Spanish aqueduct — The forts of Tunis — An
awkward dilemma — My vivandière in trouble — An English home in
Tunis — A sudden alarm.</p>

<p><em>Monday, October 17th.</em>—Returning from my walk with
Afrigan, I changed my dress and made a formal call upon the
Consul-General, Mr. Reade. I have already spoken of the fine
building occupied as the English Consulate in the little square of
the <em>Bab el Bahr</em>. This building was erected in the lifetime
of Sir Thomas Reade, the father of the present Consul. Sir Thomas
is still remembered in Tunis, where for very many years he was
honoured and trusted as the representative of no other Power was.
The Bey of his time enjoined upon his successor, when he himself
was drawing near to death, that in any difficulty he must follow
the advice of the English Consul: “he is an honest man, and England
means well by Tunis, and has<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_79">[79]</span> no secret intrigues to carry on against us.”
So when it was made known a couple of years ago or more that the
son of Sir Thomas, born during his father’s tenure of office here,
and therefore a native of the Regency, had been promoted from the
Consulate at Smyrna to the Consul-Generalship here, there was
general rejoicing throughout the country, and Mr. Reade was
welcomed with enthusiasm by all classes. I well remember how last
year in Smyrna I heard on all sides expressions of regret at the
loss which the British community there had sustained when Mr. Reade
was removed: and I can also remember hearing of his own delight at
being sent back to that which is in reality his native land—a
country which was then, just two short years ago, one of the most
prosperous, peaceful, and well-ordered States in the world. I
wondered how I should find Mr. Reade under the changed
circumstances in which he is now placed. The easy and pleasant life
to which he doubtless looked forward when he came to Tunis is for
the present at an end. For the past nine or ten months he has been
living in the midst of a whirl of exciting events, and has had to
keep a clear head and a steady eye in order to avoid a
dangerous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span> collision
with one or other of the intriguing factions which have been at
work here. Nor is this all that he has had to pass through. I have
spoken of the enthusiasm his return to Tunis excited among all
classes of the community. On his first arrival he was received by
the Bey with the greatest cordiality, and down to the month of May
last he was consulted by his Highness upon all matters of
importance. Since then all is changed; the French are here in
actual possession of Tunis, M. Roustan is supreme at the palace;
and Mr. Reade has been compelled to sink to a comparatively
subordinate position. One was curious to ascertain how our
representative had borne such a reverse of fortune as all this
implies.</p>

<p>Passing through a vaulted hall, in which half a dozen cavasses,
some of whom were unmistakable Turks of venerable aspect, were
lounging, I was ushered up a broad stone staircase to the Consul’s
apartment on the first floor. That which struck me most as I walked
up this staircase was the exquisite effect produced by the Moorish
tiles with which the walls were lined from top to bottom. It was my
first experience of a Tunisian<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_81">[81]</span> house, and it made a deep impression upon me.
One felt as though one had entered a house built of porcelain. For
cleanliness, coolness, and beauty of appearance there is nothing in
the world that will compare with these old Moorish tiles; and I
think I know one or two friends of mine of the æsthetic persuasion,
who, if they were suddenly to find themselves at the foot of this
staircase as I did this afternoon, would almost be inclined to
ascend it on their knees, out of reverence for the cunning
craftsmen who are responsible for its mural decorations.</p>

<p>Mr. Reade, a middle-aged gentleman of frank and open features
and pleasant smile, received me most kindly. There was nothing in
his manner to indicate that sense of boredom which must, I am
certain, overtake our Consuls and Ambassadors abroad when they are
beset by wandering Englishmen in search of enlightenment.
Cigarettes were produced, he laid aside his work, and plunged into
a lively conversation regarding Tunisian affairs, which afforded me
more information on the subject in a quarter of an hour than I had
been able to get from all my previous reading-up of newspapers and
pamphlets. That he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
himself felt deeply concerned regarding the events of the past year
was evident; but though quite frank in speaking of affairs he was
judiciously reticent when he alluded to men; and, strange to say, I
actually took part in a conversation on matters in Tunis in which I
heard no scandal, none of the gossip which had already begun to be
poured into my ears from different quarters.</p>

<p>One would like to paint, for the satisfaction of readers at
home, a picture of the position occupied by an English
Consul-General in a city like Tunis. It is no sinecure which he
holds. Here he is to be found day after day seated in his big chair
at his big table, dealing with all manner of documents and
applications on a thousand different subjects. In the outer room
are the trusted clerks of the Consulate, and beyond that room is a
little apartment arranged very much after the fashion of a tiny
police-court. In this place an English judge administers justice
for the benefit of the thousands of English subjects—chiefly
Maltese by birth—who reside here. When I say an English judge, I
ought to explain that Mr. Arpa, the gentleman in question, is not
an Englishman, but a Maltese. He is, of course,<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span> subordinate in rank to Mr.
Reade; and it is to the Consul-General, not to the judge, that all
matters of importance are referred. Among these at the present
moment the most pressing is probably the notorious Enfida case,
regarding which the newspapers have been full for months past, and
which is said even to have had some share in bringing about the
French expedition against Tunis. But apart from this great
suit—into the merits of which it would hardly be appropriate to
enter here—Mr. Reade has plenty of occupation in connexion with the
daily concerns of the Consulate. The shipwreck at Bizerta, of which
I heard this morning, is of itself sufficient to supply him with at
least a day’s work; for he must take the depositions of the captain
and officers, provide for the crew as distressed British subjects,
and exercise other functions in connexion with the affair. Then
there are endless matters for investigation in connexion with the
French occupation of Tunis. A British subject rushes in with some
complaint that he has been ill-treated by a French soldier. Perhaps
it is a Maltese cart-driver who has entered into a contract with
some officer of the Commissariat department<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_84">[84]</span> that he has found to be unprofitable, and
from which he wishes to be released; perhaps it is some poor fellow
who has been really hardly treated by the rather arrogant Gauls. In
either case Mr. Reade’s intervention is sought for, and will be
given.</p>

<p>There is yet another duty which, I am sure, must press hard upon
our Consuls in these parts; though, as I have said, Mr. Reade
showed no sign of feeling the hardship during his interview with
me. That is, the necessity of receiving and entertaining the
members of the “globe-trotting tribe,” to which, I am afraid, I
myself belong. Nothing can be more exigent, nothing more offensive
than the demands which are sometimes made by the globe-trotter in
search of information upon an English Consul. Some months ago a
gentleman, whose sole excuse was to be found in the fact that he
was very young and inexperienced, came to Tunis bent upon
sight-seeing. He remained a week or more in the place. On the day
of his departure he called upon the Consul-General. Mr. Reade
happened to be at luncheon at the moment when he called, and it
also happened that he was entertaining guests. He sent
a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span> polite message to
the Englishman, who had sent up his card, stating these facts, and
begging him either to wait a few minutes or to call again. Instead
of taking either course, the young prig went off in a mighty
dudgeon, and positively lodged a complaint at the Foreign Office
concerning the incivility to which he had been subjected!
Marvellous indeed are the ways of the travelling Englishman. Even
more marvellous, however, is the fact that in spite of experiences
of this kind our Consuls manage to keep their temper, and are
ready—as the occasion demands—to give a cup of coffee or a good
dinner to the wandering fellow-countryman who comes within their
ken.</p>

<p>My interview with Mr. Reade was not the last experience of this
eventful day. I called upon the gentleman whose acquaintance I had
made in the train in the early morning, Mr. P———, and was by him
introduced to his friend, Mr. B———, who occupies a prominent place
in the very small English community in Tunis. Mr. B——— at once
invited me to go for a drive with him outside the city walls, and
accordingly we started in an open carriage and pair. Passing
through the narrow and<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_86">[86]</span> crowded streets of the city, we quickly
reached one of the gateways, now guarded by French as well as
Tunisian troops, and passed out into the open country. Away from
the city walls stretches a desolate yellow plain, interspersed with
dense hedges of prickly pear. Running across this plain, in a long
ghostly line of crumbling arches, may be seen the remains of the
famous Spanish aqueduct which once supplied Tunis with water. It is
not a work of very ancient date. Probably its age does not exceed
three hundred years. Yet more than one visitor to Tunis who has
afterwards recorded his impressions of the place in writing, has
fallen into the ludicrous error of confounding this work with the
Phœnician or Roman aqueduct by which Carthage obtained its
water-supply.</p>

<p>In one respect the country round Tunis resembles that round
Paris. Almost every height which commands the city is crowned by a
fort. On nearly all these forts to-day the French flag was flying
above that of the Bey. During the course of the ride we passed
close to a large encampment of Bedouins from the interior, who have
flocked in multitudes to the capital since<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_87">[87]</span> the troubles began; and who are here,
according to my companion, for no good purpose. Wild, dark-skinned
men and women these Bedouins are. The women go unveiled when
outside the city walls, and many of them have a savage comeliness
of feature that affords a striking contrast to the European
standard of good looks. There was no friendliness on their faces as
we drove past them this afternoon. Near to their encampment is a
picturesque little Arab village standing in a hollow by the
wayside. Two days ago a French soldier, tempted by the bright eyes
of a Bedouin girl, ventured into this village in pursuit of her. He
has never been seen since; and no one doubts that he has paid with
his life for his recklessness and folly. Unfortunately, it is not
only the reckless or the foolish who are in danger. At any moment
an Arab fanatic—and the whole race are seething with fanaticism
just now—might take it into his head to secure a short cut to
Paradise by means of despatching an infidel, and woe then to the
first European whom he might encounter! A quick eye, a steady hand,
and a good revolver would alone suffice to save him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>The sun had set,
and the southern night had fallen with its usual rapidity before we
got back to the town. We had a fright on finding the first gate we
reached closed; for a night outside the city walls meant perils
which were not lightly to be contemplated. Happily, we found the
gate adjoining the kasbah, or citadel, still open, and through it
we entered the city in safety. Scarcely had we done so when the
heavy gates were closed and locked with a mighty clanging of iron,
not to be opened again until after sunrise to-morrow. It gives one
a curious sensation, that of being locked in—even though you are
locked into a city as big as Tunis. Outside lies the wild, open
country, where no man’s life is safe; where bands of Arab marauders
are constantly wandering from village to village, robbing, burning,
slaying; and where, if any European were to be found after
nightfall, his life would not be worth an hour’s purchase. It may
be a relief to feel that in closing these gates they have shut out
the lawless forces of the desert; but on the other hand there is
the uncomfortable feeling of being a prisoner, and of having for
one’s fellow-prisoners nearly 100,000 men,<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_89">[89]</span> each one of whom would esteem it a virtue if
he were to kill you, and from whom, under certain circumstances,
you need expect no more mercy than from the Bedouins of the parched
and yellow plains outside.</p>

<p>Through the dark and winding streets we found our way at last to
my hotel, where B——— dined with me, in a room swarming with French
officers, who smoked and expectorated and otherwise indulged
themselves on all sides of us, whilst we struggled through a
distasteful meal. Outside, after dinner, I met with an old friend,
and alas! a friend in trouble. This was my fair vivandière of the
<em>Charles Quint</em>. With tear-stained face and broken voice she
explained to me her deplorable situation. Would it be believed that
a Frenchman, and a French general to boot, had been so cruel, so
utterly wanting in gallantry, as to issue an order that she, a
woman of reputation, decorated, celebrated, and devoted to the
sacred work of charity, should put off her uniform? And here her
self-command failed utterly, and she burst into passionate sobs.
“But, madam,” I ventured to urge, “you can nurse just as well in an
ordinary dress as in that you are<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_90">[90]</span> now wearing.” “Oh, no, monsieur, no! Besides,
<em>me</em> to put on an ordinary dress! and to put off the uniform
which I love—” and here she glanced downwards at that dual garment
which the polite American hesitates to mention in the presence of
ladies. Tears were in her eyes, sobs in her throat, grief in her
heart, and, I regret to say, a strong suspicion of cognac in her
breath. A young officer came up to console her, and she turned away
in haste from the phlegmatic Englishman. The last that I saw of her
was leaning upon the shoulder of her brave fellow-countryman, and
plentifully bedewing his blue uniform with her tears, whilst the
Arab servants in the hall of the hotel looked on in mute
amazement.</p>

<p>I accompanied B——— to his house in the town. It lies in a narrow
alley, approached by many windings and turnings from the Grande
Rue. To an Englishman it seems astonishing that any decent person
could live in this contracted and evil-smelling passage; which in
dimensions, cleanliness, and airiness resembles one of those
“fever-haunts of Leeds” with which in former years I had a painful
familiarity. Things are measured by<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_91">[91]</span> different standards in the East and the West,
however, and this black and ill-paved slum, decidedly worse in
outward aspect than any ordinary London alley, is looked upon here
as a suitable place of residence for an English gentleman, a
barrister, and a man of influence. Once inside the house itself, of
course, I found everything as it ought to be. The house is built on
the true Moorish pattern; that is to say, it is in the form of a
hollow square, the doors and windows of the various rooms on each
floor opening upon an interior gallery. This form of building is
common to hot countries, and it has the great advantage of warding
off the rays of the sun from the various apartments. Indeed, the
sun is here regarded as an enemy, and a fatal drawback to any house
would be the fact that it had unsheltered outside windows. Tiled
floors and walls and wooden ceilings gave a bare and unfinished
appearance to my friend’s home; though there were pictures,
bric-à-brac, couches, and valuable Kairwan carpets in
abundance.</p>

<p>B——— is an enthusiast on all Tunisian affairs, and no man living
probably knows more than he does of the disgraceful
events<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span> which have led
up to the occupation of this city. He it was to whom the Bey
confided the task of drawing up his protest against the insolent
demand of M. Roustan for the signature of the famous or infamous
Treaty of May 12th. That protest was telegraphed to all the
European powers during the few hours of grace which Roustan allowed
to the unfortunate ruler, whilst French troops were being drawn up
round the Bardo Palace in order to compel the Bey’s final
acquiescence. Needless to say, it was intensely interesting to hear
from the lips of one who had been himself an actor in these
transactions the narrative of the struggle against the intrigues of
France. Graphic portraits were sketched by B——— of M. Roustan and
his detestable <em>entourage</em>, the most prominent figures in
the picture being a certain M. Elias and his wife, a lady whose
career might well be made the subject of a (French) romance. The
military operations, too, were explained to me by the aid of a map,
and I was bidden to wait for the forthcoming march upon Kairwan. As
for the actual situation in Tunis itself, B——— took the gloomiest
view. The exasperation<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_93">[93]</span> of the Arabs, he declared, was intense, and
“anything might happen” at any moment. An insult offered by a
French soldier to an Arab woman would suffice to set the city in
flames, and a catastrophe of unexampled magnitude might follow.
Indeed, according to my interlocutor, it was only the presence of
the French troops in the city which prevented a general massacre of
the Europeans; and there was really occasion to apprehend that such
a massacre might be attempted by the more fanatical Arabs at any
given moment.</p>

<p>This lively picture of the dangers of the situation, painted as
it was in that quaint, gloomy, cavernous sitting-room in the
strange Moorish house, was rather calculated to try the nerves of a
new-comer, and as B——— depicted to me the dangers attending any
wandering in even the most frequented parts of Tunis after
nightfall, I began most fervently to wish myself safe again in the
shelter of my hotel. Even as I was pondering upon the dark and
intricate passages which I must traverse on my way to my
sleeping-place, a sudden sound startled us both. It was the firing
of a rifle in the street<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_94">[94]</span> below us. We listened, breathless, for a few
seconds; and then, hearing nothing further, stepped out upon the
quaint curved iron balcony overhanging the doorway. Nothing was to
be seen except a group of cloaked Arabs, moving stealthily away in
the distance. B——— pressed me to remain at his house for the night,
but I thought it better to return to my hotel; and as he sent his
servant—a good-looking young Jew in Arab costume—to show me the
way, the only difficulty I experienced in passing through the unlit
streets was from my constant stumbling over bits of broken ground,
or my occasional encounters with the savage dogs, which are only
less numerous here than they are in Stamboul.</p>

<p class="sch">A DAY AT CARTHAGE.</p>

<p class="csum">The pious Æneas — A street scene — A nondescript
vehicle — The road to Carthage — A wayside tragedy — Bedouin
children — <em>Delenda est Carthago</em> — An Empire’s dust —
Dido’s Palace — The cisterns of Carthage — A lovely situation — The
College of St. Louis — English ladies in Tunis.</p>

<p><em>Tuesday, October 18th.</em>—A trip to Carthage is an event
which recalls one’s earliest memories of classic lore. How many
years, I wonder, is it since I was tearfully engaged in construing
the well-thumbed pages in which the adventures of the lovely Dido
and the “pious” Æneas are recorded? And wherefore, I wonder,
<em>was</em> Æneas pious? So far as schoolboys are concerned, that
marvellous faculty of blubbering at will over his own misfortunes
which this particular hero possessed has caused him to be generally
regarded as something very like a milksop. But there has never been
any doubt in the schoolboy’s mind regarding the beauty of Dido. Has
he not had a due sense of it flogged into him in his very earliest
struggles<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span> with the
Latin tongue? I vow that when I got out of bed this morning and
prepared myself for a trip to Carthage, a slight sensation of alarm
troubled me. The names of Dido and Æneas recalled quite too
painfully the memories of good Dr. Birch, and of the times when I
was at the mercy of his stern assistants. Little did I dream in
those days of ever seeing Carthage itself. Yet here I was, just on
the point of starting for the place where the wonderful city once
stood; and that being so, why should I not find my lovely Dido
still sitting there, watching with tear-dimmed eyes the flying bark
of her faithless lover? I had left the world of sober realities
behind me at Marseilles, and had come into a sort of Arabian
Nights’ country in which anything might happen, and in which it was
one of my main duties to be astonished at nothing.</p>

<p>The big airy bedchamber was hot enough when I awoke, albeit the
heavy wooden shutters were closed and the light excluded. A
detestable mosquito had been buzzing about my ears all through the
night, and now there were certain small swellings on my neck which
told where he had feasted upon my blood.<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_97">[97]</span> The faithful Afrigan appeared upon the scene
with the welcome tub, a small cup of particularly bad coffee, and a
roll that was supposed to represent the nearest approach to
Parisian bread to be obtained in this quarter of the world.
Happily, he spared me the sight and the smell of the
garlic-drenched oily abomination which passes here for butter. A
cigarette, however, put matters right, and before my not very
elaborate toilette was completed, I found myself standing upon the
balcony outside the window surveying the brilliant street below me.
Brilliant, indeed, it is; not only in the sunshine that lights up
everything with an illumination the startling vividness of which no
dweller beneath the murky skies of England can understand, but in
the splendidly picturesque costumes and figures which go flitting
past the house in an endless procession. There was not a single
person in European costume to be seen in the street when I looked
out this morning; but a hundred Arabs were going to and fro. There
were men vending water, and fruit, and cakes; there were wonderful
little shoeblacks, all aglow with scarlet garments; there were
black mule-drivers trudging onwards with<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_98">[98]</span> impassive faces, and scores of sleek Moors in
ghostly white marching slowly up and down the broad road regardless
of the terrible sun which was pouring its fiercest rays upon their
turbaned heads. Now and then some camels went past heavily laden;
then a beggar trudged along, in rags and sores, raising a cry for
pity in the name of Allah; then a stout old Jewess and her handsome
daughters waddled slowly past, the latter with strange unwieldy
gait, but flashing eyes and rosy lips; and then our sweet European
civilization made itself visible in the shape of a detachment of
French infantry, briskly marching to the rub-a-dub of the drum.</p>

<p>But meanwhile Afrigan was awaiting me at the door of the hotel
with a curious vehicle, not unlike a small four-post bedstead
mounted upon wheels. Loose curtains hung all round the upper part
of the framework, so that shelter could be obtained in any
direction from the heat of the sun, whilst a pleasant draught of
air could also at all times be admitted. A couple of good horses
were attached to this nondescript conveyance, which was in the
charge of a Maltese of most villainous aspect. Away we went, with
much<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span> cracking of
whips and jingling of bells, through the crowded streets of the
native quarter; past the coffee-houses, each one of which, with its
wonderful, sombre interior, and its group of dark and sullen faces
peering out at us as we drove by, would have made a delightful
picture; under the quaint arches of the great gateway, and so out
into the open yellow plain beyond.</p>

<p>It was a hot, a very hot drive of nearly two hours to Carthage.
All the way our road lay across that sandy desert. The only things
now growing upon it are the gnarled and twisted olive-trees, and
enormous tangles of prickly pear, the leaves of which have attained
so vast a size that if I were to venture upon figures I should no
doubt have the eternal verities of Baron Munchausen flung at my
head by the sceptical. But though the country through which we thus
passed is so dreary just now, in the spring, when it is covered by
a veil of living green, it must be wonderfully beautiful. And even
as it is there are picturesque sights in abundance to compensate
for the barrenness of the soil. Here we pass a kitchen garden.
Perhaps a few stunted vegetables are growing<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_100">[100]</span> in it; more probably it only shows you a
few sticks rising two or three inches from the soil. But a couple
of Arabs are hard at work gardening, and mark the cunning care with
which they are constructing little canals of the loose soil, by
means of which the water which the ox is pumping out of yonder well
may be carried in any desired direction. Here a whole party of
Arabs are engaged in building a wall round some native house that
stands by the road-side, and even the bricklayers in this part of
the world are picturesque. Then there are the carts, the mules, the
camels without end which we meet upon the road. It is noticeable
that no salutation is given as we roll past. A curious or sullen
glance is the only intimation of the fact that we are seen by the
wayfarers.</p>

<p>Up to this point we have been driving along the road which leads
to Goletta, and the great lake has been glittering in the sunlight
to our right. Now, however, we turn into the direct road for
Carthage. There are few people to be met with here. A chance
shepherd tending his flock, or a Bedouin man and woman resting
beneath some olive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
or palm-tree, alone break the solitude of the scene. My companion
points out to me a stately date-palm, with magnificent feathered
top, standing a little away from the sandy track which serves as a
road. It marks the precise spot where a couple of weeks ago a foul
murder was committed. The victim was one of the unfortunate Maltese
coachmen of Tunis; the murderer a major in the service of the Bey.
The major engaged the coachman to drive him to Carthage, and when
opposite this palm-tree shot him through the heart. There were
plenty of Arabs upon the road at the time, but none of them
interfered. It was only a wretched infidel who had met with his
deserts: why should they trouble themselves in the matter? So the
assassin got clean off, and has not since been heard of; nor does
anybody believe that he is likely to be punished. As for his
motives, they were apparently, as in the case of most murderers, a
little mixed. There was a good deal of religious fanaticism and
political hatred at the bottom of the crime; but there was also one
ugly fact in connexion with it which tends to deprive the murderer
of the crown of glory to which he would be entitled in<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span> the eyes of his
co-religionists if he had taken the man’s life out of a pure hatred
of the abominable Christian. That is the fact that he had
previously shown himself not above borrowing money from the
aforesaid Christian, and that he had forgotten to repay that money.
Such is the tale with which Afrigan beguiles the way, as my
carriage rolls rapidly onwards towards the hill once crowned by the
towers of Carthage, and now marked by the imposing pile of the
College of St. Louis.</p>

<p>As we approach that hill we have occasion to pass close to an
encampment of Bedouins. The savage dogs from the tents rush out,
barking furiously: the scarcely less savage children, tawny, naked,
with long hair streaming in the wind, follow them, and fly towards
us, shrieking out, “<em>Caroub, caroub!</em>” I fling them some
small coins; they pick them up eagerly, and then, without a word or
a gesture of thanks, but much after the fashion in which a hungry
dog takes himself off with a bone, dart back towards their rude
dwellings. And now the horses toil through a sandy cutting up a
steep hill-side, and I find myself actually upon the site of
Carthage. The impression which follows the first look round upon
this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span> spot, once so
important in the world’s affairs and still so famous in the records
of history, is one of intense disappointment. Remembering what I
saw a year ago at Ephesus, I had hoped to find here, as on the site
of the famous city of Asia Minor, some striking and extensive
remains of the ancient town. But <em>delenda est Carthago</em>! The
Roman’s wish has been fulfilled, and of the once glorious city of
Carthage it may now be said with literal accuracy that not one
stone remains standing upon another above ground. Yet you tread
here, in no figurative sense but in very truth, upon an Empire’s
dust. The whole site of the city is strewn with the broken
fragments of pottery, mosaic, sculptured marbles, pillars, and
tiles. Everywhere, too, huge fallen masses of masonry are lying
prone upon the earth. The site of Carthage, I believe, has not yet
been explored with modern thoroughness. Day by day men come here
from the College of St. Louis or the neighbourhood and dig for an
hour or two; and sometimes the treasures which they turn up as the
result of their desultory labour are of great value. The best of
these treasures have been carried away to enrich<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span> the museums of Europe; but no
one can doubt that much still remains to be discovered, and I doubt
not that thorough and systematic investigations carried on upon
this spot would reveal many objects of value and interest which
once adorned the streets and palaces of Carthage.</p>

<p>Stumbling over the broken blocks of masonry, among which the
lizards, sole inhabitants of the city, were running swiftly, I
walked a short distance seaward past the site of Dido’s palace, and
came thus to the place where the only extensive remains of the
greatness of Carthage are to be found. These are the cisterns which
once furnished a portion of the water-supply of the city. Just as
Professor Owen can reconstruct an extinct animal if only a single
bone of its skeleton has been preserved, so it is an easy matter
for those who have seen these wonderful cisterns to form an
approximate idea of the grandeur of the city to which they
belonged. They are vast subterranean structures, with heavy vaulted
roofs, intended to shut out from the cool water in the mighty tanks
the heat of the African sun. But time has made many a breach in
these great arches, and the<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_105">[105]</span> light of day in consequence streams in upon
corridors and chambers which eighteen hundred years ago were
jealously shrouded in midnight gloom.</p>

<p>Some of the cisterns are circular in shape, and look like
nothing so much as enormous wells; the majority, however, are of
oblong form. In every case the masonry is of the most substantial
description, showing how well the Phœnicians did their work. Even
more remarkable, however, than the quality of the masonry, is that
of the lining of cement upon the walls of the cisterns. It is as
perfect to-day as on the day, probably more than two thousand years
distant, when it was spread upon these walls. The very marks of the
trowels used in spreading it are quite distinct, and here and there
may be seen the coarse imprint of some workman’s thumb—a sight to
ponder over at one’s leisure. I had a strange “eerie” feeling upon
me as I trod the long covered corrider that runs the length of the
whole series of cisterns, and thought of the time when above where
I now walked the tumultuous life of a great city had rolled in its
majestic fulness of power. Most of the cisterns were half filled
with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span> rubbish that
had fallen when the arches of the roof gave way; but presently I
came to some which seemed to be comparatively little injured, and
at last to one that—so far as I could tell—was as perfect as on the
day when the Phœnician workmen left it and the cool waters were
first allowed to flow into it. It was a beautiful, dimly-lighted
chamber, with walls and roof and floor white and clean; and it
contained pure crystal water to the depth of five or six feet. So
bright and refreshing was that water, so delightful the contrast
which this cool, shady apartment presented to the burning heat and
glare outside, that I looked about to see if there were any means
by which I could descend and bathe in this vast tank. None,
however, were visible; and after a while I had to leave the arched
corridor and to return to the blaze of the sunshine.</p>

<p>These cisterns of Carthage certainly suffice to give one some
idea of what the great city must have been in its prime. Nor are
these the only traces of the efforts put forth by the inhabitants
to obtain a constant supply of good water. Other cisterns, similar
to those I have described, lie at a short distance<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span> from the shore. They are now,
however, occupied by a tribe of Bedouins, and it is dangerous to
visit them without an escort. Then, again, for miles across the
sandy plain between Carthage and Tunis, a crumbling line of huge
blocks of masonry may be seen. These are the remnants of the
aqueduct which in later days brought the water from the Zaghouan
hills to Carthage. Nowadays the Tunisians are supplied with water
from these same hills, and it was but the other day that the Arabs,
in order to avenge themselves upon the French, cut the existing
aqueduct, and for a time deprived Tunis of one of the great
necessaries of life.</p>

<p>Upon one point nobody who has visited Carthage can be in any
doubt, and that is as to the surpassing loveliness of its
situation. I know of no city, with the exception of Constantinople,
that occupies a site which can be compared with this. Even that of
Ephesus is inferior in splendour, if not in interest. The great
city occupied an amphitheatre sloping gently down to the edge of
the gulf. The blue waters of the Mediterranean must have washed
against the marble steps of its palaces. Indeed, looking down
to-day<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span> from the
spot where, according to tradition, Dido’s palace once stood, I
could distinctly perceive beneath the surface of the sea the vast
blocks which once marked out the site of the jetties and quays of
the ancient port. Beyond the glorious expanse of sparkling waves,
there were the fine masses of the Lead Mountains, encircling the
gulf; inland could be seen the silver sheet of the Lake of Tunis,
whilst in the dim distance the hoary crests of the ever-present
Zaghouan range pierced the cloudless sky. Amid the lassitude
produced by the intense heat which everywhere prevailed, both mind
and body were refreshed by the exquisite loveliness of the scene,
and by the delicious breeze which swept down from the mountains,
and came to us laden with the briny odours of the gulf.</p>

<p>Absolutely desolate as is the particular part of the site of
Carthage where the principal remains are to be found, it must not
be supposed that the entire space once occupied by the great city
now lies waste. On the top of the chief hill enclosed within the
boundaries of the place stands the College of St. Louis, an
establishment conducted by the Jesuits under the protection of the
French<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span> Government,
where the children of most of the European residents in the Regency
are educated. Down below, on the edge of the shore, are the houses
of some Moorish notabilities—beautiful water-palaces, reminding me
by their situation and architecture of those which line the
Bosphorus. In other directions a few Arab farm-houses are
scattered, each enclosed in its impregnable hedge of prickly pear;
whilst hanging on the sharp crest of the hill to the west, which
once looked down upon Carthage, is the walled Arab town of
Sidi-bou-Said, now occupied by men so fanatical that the life of no
European who ventured within it would be safe. It was with real
regret that I turned away from this beautiful scene—so striking in
itself, so interesting in all its associations—and began the long
drive back to Tunis. There were many interesting spectacles along
the way, one of the most curious being the appearance of the Caid
or Judge of Tunis, clad in gorgeous raiment, and riding in a
handsome brougham, escorted by Arab outriders. But the effects of
the heat and the fatigue I had undergone were too great to be
resisted, and before half the distance had been
traversed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span> I was
sleeping soundly, unconscious even of the terrible jolting of my
carriage in the deep ruts of an African highway.</p>

<p>“Adventures,” says Lord Beaconsfield, “are to the adventurous.”
I have often consoled myself with the saying when, in the course of
my little wanderings, I have met with personal adventures of a
trying character. But really I have the strongest objection to
being troubled by the adventures of other adventurous people. Like
every other properly constituted tourist, I look down with a
certain measure of contempt upon all others of my tribe, and am
only anxious to give them the widest possible berth. Imagine, then,
my feelings when, upon alighting at the Grand Hotel on my return,
hot, hungry, dusty, and thirsty, from my trip to Carthage, I was
coolly informed by the manager that he had been compelled to turn
me out of my big, airy room, in order to make way for somebody
else. “You see, monsieur, it was a double-bedded room,” he
observed, in answer to my first expostulations. “And where, then,
am I to be put?” “Ah well! monsieur, we cannot say at present; but
you shall have a room before bed-time.”<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_111">[111]</span> This was a particularly pleasant
announcement to be received by a weary traveller who was anxious to
refresh himself by plentiful ablutions. I kept my temper, however,
until I had asked another question: “Where are my things?” My
“things” were, of course, the contents of my two portmanteaus,
which I had left scattered about my apartment in the early morning.
In reply, the manager pointed to a heap in a dark corner of the
dusty corridor. There were my books, my writing materials, my
linen, my coats, my toilette apparatus, all heaped up together,
promiscuously. Then—the storm broke. I was convinced that I had
been treated in this infamous manner for the benefit of some French
general. It was too much to be borne. I had just five minutes of it
without interruption in the hall of the Grand Hotel—as good a five
minutes of free, unlimited, polyglottic deliverance of one’s mind
as I had ever enjoyed in the course of my life. I had, of course,
the greatest personal satisfaction when I expressed myself in
English; a double satisfaction, because not only had I the fullest
command of words in that tongue, but I could use the strongest
epithets with impunity,<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_112">[112]</span> as neither the manager, who stood pale and
scowling, receiving my outpouring of wrath with deprecating
gestures, nor the attendants understood a syllable of what I said.
But I was pleased to find that my French also was admirably adapted
to convey some idea of the state of my mind on this occasion; and I
chuckled inwardly as I reflected upon the fact that I had not
mastered the <em>argot</em> of Paris uselessly.</p>

<p>Suddenly the door of the room from which I had been so summarily
expelled was opened; I turned with a frown to see the man by whom I
had been supplanted. O, horror! It was no man at all. There stood a
woman, middle-aged, gentle, refined, evidently somewhat alarmed,
and behind her a pretty young girl of seventeen, who was apparently
more amused than frightened by the altercation. What did it mean?
From what quarter of the world could this unexpected apparition in
Tunis have sprung? The frown disappeared with marvellous rapidity
from my face; I took off my hat and began to explain to them
volubly that I was delighted to think that they had got such a good
room, that I hoped they had not been disturbed by my<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span> scolding of the servants, that
I should be only too glad to be of service to them, &amp;c.,
&amp;c. I said anything I could think of, in fact, to cover my
shame at having been aroused to a somewhat unusual ebullition of
temper by the sacrifice of my comfort to that of a couple of women,
whilst at the same time I rejoiced to think that at least they did
not understand the English I had been pouring out upon the devoted
heads of the people around me. Alas! my confusion was made complete
when the elderly lady said to me, “But you are an Englishman, are
you not? And we are Englishwomen!”</p>

<p>There was nothing for it but to make an ample apology to them in
my native tongue. They received it with the best possible grace,
protesting, indeed, that it was they from whom apologies were due.
And then the elder lady explained to me how it was that she and her
daughter found themselves in Tunis. They were on their way from
Genoa to Malta, where they meant to pass the winter, and they
thought they would like to take Tunis on the way, “it was such a
romantic place.” “But do you not know,<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_114">[114]</span> madam, that the country is in a state of
war? that the Arabs may rise at any moment, that even in Tunis
one’s life is not safe?” No; they knew nothing at all upon that
subject. They had simply seen that they could get a steamer from
Genoa to Tunis, and another after an interval of twenty-four hours
from Tunis to Malta. So these two unprotected Englishwomen had
coolly come into Tunis, and were quite prepared to go for a walk by
themselves into the very midst of the native quarter, if they were
not warned of their danger! I enjoined upon them the necessity of
taking their meals in their own room, “and a very comfortable room
you’ll find it, ma’am,” I said, with the best smile I could summon
up for the occasion; and then as I was to dine out by arrangement,
at the Hôtel de Paris, to meet B———, M. Camile Pelletan, the French
Deputy, and one or two other gentlemen, I lent Afrigan to them for
the remainder of the day, warning them that they must upon no
account disobey any orders he might give them. It was really
wonderful how my righteous wrath had subsided when I found that it
was for no French<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
general, but for a couple of English ladies, that I had been turned
out of my room. And yet what madness on the part of Englishwomen to
come touring in Tunis at this moment!</p>

<p class="sch">WALKS ABOUT TUNIS.</p>

<p class="csum">The English burial-ground — A sad spot — The author
of “Home, sweet Home” — An Arab fortune-teller — On the top of a
volcano — The “fanatical quarters” — More eastern than the East —
Shopping in the bazaars — Mohamed the shopkeeper — Driving a
bargain — Time <em>versus</em> money.</p>

<p><em>Saturday, October 22nd.</em>—The story of my life from day
to day in Tunis might be apt to weary some people if it were told
in the fulness of detail which might be used. It is a story of
walks and drives in and around this wonderful city; of visits to
the quarters inhabited by the most fanatical of the Arabs, of risky
trips into the surrounding country, when it has been absolutely
necessary to watch closely any chance wayfarer whom one might
encounter, in order to be ready to have the first shot in case of
need; and of interviews with some of the notabilities of the place.
Perhaps I cannot do better than sum up in one general survey the
events of the past three or four days, and my experiences during
that time. On the morning after my<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_117">[117]</span> visit to Carthage I was up betimes, in
order to speed the two English ladies who had dispossessed me of my
room, on their way to Malta. They were very proud of having made a
hurried raid into the bazaar under the guidance of Afrigan on the
previous afternoon, and they bore away in triumph a piece of loot
in the shape of a large brass salver, curiously engraved in
Arabic.</p>

<p>Having seen mother and daughter safely deposited in the train
for Goletta, I set off to visit the English burying-ground. I have
seen many burial-places in the course of my life, but none by which
I have been so much impressed as by this last resting-place of so
many of my fellow-countrymen in “a strange land.” It is very small,
certainly not more than half an acre in extent, and is entered
through a vaulted archway. The gate is kept locked, though I
believe that no outrage has ever been committed. Passing out of the
crowded streets of the native town into this silent and deserted
graveyard, a strange feeling of unreality came over me. Somehow or
other, I was reminded of the wonderful passage in “Esmond” in which
the hero describes his visit to his mother’s grave in
the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span> burying-ground
of the Belgian convent. Like Esmond, I seemed, as I moved across
that solemn plot of ground, to be walking beneath the sea and
treading among the bones of shipwrecked men. But here there were no
nuns raising their voices heavenward, nor any chapel into which one
of my own faith might creep to meditate and pray. All round were
the high walls and barred windows of the Arab houses—a strange,
unfriendly outlook from these mouldering graves. The noise of the
city penetrated even into the silent place of the dead; but it was
a strange and unfamiliar noise, having little in common with the
sounds of city life at home. The fierce sun was beating down upon
the narrow graveyard; all round me were tombs and flowers.</p>

<p>For nearly two hundred years those of our race who finished
their days in this strange country have been buried here, and the
rose, the heliotrope, and the myrtle have been left to flower and
fade luxuriantly above their dust. Many English Consuls are buried
here; some of them having been the representatives of England at
the Court of the Bey at the time when Tunis was a nest of pirates,
and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span> when cruelty
and lust such as nowadays it hardly enters into one’s mind to
conceive were rampant on this spot. And there are “merchant
adventurers” of the last century, who must have had bold hearts
when they came hither in search of fortune. All that remains of
them now is, here and there, a quaint inscription telling us how
they feared God and honoured the King; how they loved their
fellow-men, and amid all the temptations of Babylon were true to
the faith of their fathers and of their far-off native land. Then
there are the graves of women, the wives of the few Englishmen who
have from time to time sought fortune here; and—saddest of all—the
graves of little children who bore English names and had English
blood in their veins, but who were fated never to know the dear
mother country and the blessings of home. My heart was too full for
utterance, as I moved about among these graves. Only some two or
three of my fellow-countrymen were to be met with in the whole
Regency among the living; but here among the dead I found myself
surrounded by many familiar names, and by inscriptions in the
English tongue, which bore texts of Holy Writ that<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span> were graven as deeply upon my
own heart as upon the stones of the burial-ground.</p>

<p>For the first time since I came to Tunis a great wave of
home-sickness swept over me. How far off we—I and the silent dead
beneath my feet—seemed to be from the land of our birth! And even
as this thought was surging through my heart, my eye fell upon one
special grave for which I had been searching. There was a plain
stone slab, surrounded by a little bed of heliotrope and dwarf
roses, and it bore an inscription telling how beneath it lay
“Colonel John Howard Payne, a citizen of the United States of
America,” and how this monument had been erected by his grateful
fellow-countrymen in honour of the author of “Home, sweet Home.”
Strange indeed is the irony of Fate. We shape our own destinies in
fancy; we plan and plot and labour and contrive; and each one of us
for himself has formed his own ideal of the end at which, in due
season, in the fulness of his time, he is to arrive: and probably
not once, in the whole history of the human race, has that end,
when it did come, been in harmony with the visions thus indulged
in. But surely, of all the strange<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_121">[121]</span> freaks of malicious fortune, there has been
none stranger, none sadder, than that which sent the man who wrote
“Home, sweet Home” to die an exile on African soil, and which has
left him to a grave here among our English dead of Tunis! I cleared
away the mass of fallen leaves from that gravestone, and reverently
plucked a spray of heliotrope and a few leaves from the rose-trees,
and turned and went on my way again, filled with the feeling that,
for a brief season, I had been moving in quite another world from
that of the living, and that within the narrow boundaries of that
pathetic graveyard of my kinsmen in a strange land, I had been
holding the most solemn and the most real communion with the
dead.</p>

<p>It was on the following day that, returning from a walk with
Afrigan through the bazaars, I encountered a curious figure seated
at the roadside which instantly attracted my attention. This was an
Arab fortune-teller. At the moment when I came up to him he was
busy unwinding the long folds of his turban; and like most of the
Arabs with whom I came in contact in Tunis, he showed no
disposition to court my support.<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_122">[122]</span> In front of him was a tray on which fine
sand was spread. This I need hardly say is the ordinary
writing-tablet of the Arab, the slate by means of which he makes
his calculations. At the side of this slate were a pile of tattered
Arabic books, a dirty pack of cards, and one or two other articles
appertaining to the trade of divination. My fortune-teller was a
shrewd, elderly Arab, with a quick and sinister eye, but a not
unpleasant expression upon his somewhat greasy face. Afrigan acting
as interpreter, I explained to him that I wished to consult him. I
was told to take a <em>caroub</em> (a penny) in my hand and to
think meanwhile of the person or subject on which I wanted
information, and then to give the coin to the fortune-teller. This
I did accordingly. The Arab looked earnestly for a moment at the
<em>caroub</em>, and then began to count with great rapidity, at
the same time marking down various figures upon his tray of sand.
When he had arrived at certain results he smoothed the sand, thus
wiping out the figures, and began again. This went on for a
considerable time, until at last he seemed to have reached his
desired end. He gave a last triumphant dash of the hand
over<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span> his curious
slate, and then turning to me, said, “You are going away soon; you
will have a stormy voyage and a long one, but you will travel in
safety; those about whom you were thinking just now are quite well,
and they are thinking much of you now, when you are absent; more
even than they did when you were with them. All is well.” What
could be more satisfactory than this, and how could I avoid giving
the man an extra fee for his good news?</p>

<p>Strange, indeed, are the workings of the human mind. I knew
perfectly well that the cunning old Arab was the veriest charlatan,
and that the glib phrases he had uttered were merely the
common-places with which he gratified all travellers who came to
him for advice, whether they were tawny Bedouins from the Sahara,
coal-black negroes from the Soudan, or pale-faced infidels from
beyond the seas: yet I declare I positively resumed my walk after
my short interview with the rogue in better spirits than I had been
in before. After all, was he not probably right? I said to myself;
and were there not kind thoughts speeding across land and sea in my
direction from those whom I loved at home? Let it be<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span> noted in passing that one or
two of the fortune-teller’s fellow-countrymen had gathered round
whilst he was thus foretelling my lot, and that evident
gratification was depicted upon their faces when they found that my
fate was to be a favourable one. After all, even in the midst of
this seething mass of fanaticism, a great deal of “human nature” is
to be found; and so far as my experience of it goes, human nature
is, as a rule, very apt to be kindly and lenient in its
disposition.</p>

<p>And yet what a volcano is that upon which we are treading here
in Tunis! Yesterday afternoon my good friend Mr. B———, who is
showing himself most kind and attentive in all possible ways, went
with me for a drive through the worst quarters of the town. B———
did not conceal either from himself or from me the fact that there
was considerable risk in the expedition. But he believed that it
must be undertaken if I were to have any real knowledge of Tunis;
and therefore, disregarding the chance of a stray bullet being
directed at us by some fanatic, we set off to explore those parts
of the city where the natives are most closely packed together, and
where the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
anti-Christian feeling runs highest. Without the aid of a pencil,
or rather of a brush glowing with colours of many hues, I cannot
pretend to give any adequate idea of the sights that I encountered
during that delightful and exciting ride. Very soon after leaving
the Marina we found ourselves involved in the midst of a labyrinth
of the narrowest, the most tortuous, the most tumble-down lanes and
alleys that ever represented the streets of a great town. Very
often the carriage grazed the walls on both sides as it passed
along. At other times we found ourselves traversing long dark
vaulted passages beneath the houses, which in Tunis, as I have
already said, are often built over as well as at the side of the
thoroughfares. On each side of us for almost the entire distance
were shops and Arab coffee-houses. They all looked as though they
had been transferred bodily, by some deed of magic, from the pages
of the “Arabian Nights.”</p>

<p>There was nothing that I had seen in Stamboul to compare with
the orientalism of the scenes that now met my eyes. Every interior
was in itself a perfect picture. Here<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_126">[126]</span> was a row of small shops occupied by the
workers in iron. Each particular smith was squatting on his
haunches on the raised floor of the little apartment, hammering
some metal vessel into the required shape, or blowing the brazier
of glowing charcoal with a pair of bellows of primitive
construction. Here again was the quarter occupied by the dealers in
earthenware, whose gay stores of Arab pottery offered to the eye a
mass of rich and varied colour. But after all it was in the
numberless coffee-houses and barbers’ shops that I found the chief
attraction; for here the Arabs were at home, and their infinite
variety of costume, complexion, and attitude was almost
bewildering. As our carriage moved slowly along through these
narrow, crowded streets, we passed literally thousands of natives
whom our driver warned of our approach by hoarse cries. The women
turned away, thickly veiled though they were, as though they were
defiled by mere proximity to the hated Christian. As for the men,
they regarded us for a moment with scowling faces and sinister
eyes, and then ostentatiously averted their heads, evidently for
the purpose of marking their resentment<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_127">[127]</span> at our presence. I looked back quickly once
or twice, and saw these sullen-faced Moors spitting upon the ground
over which our carriage had passed, and cursing us in the name of
Allah! It was altogether a novel and exciting ride. Once or twice
when our carriage was stopped in some particularly narrow
thoroughfare my companion showed signs of alarm, and one felt upon
the whole glad that a revolver formed part of one’s equipment; but
any risk that there might be was more than compensated by the
strangeness and picturesqueness of the scenes that everywhere
presented themselves in those winding and tortuous streets, with
their quaint Moorish houses and their numberless specimens of all
those races who are the followers of the Prophet.</p>

<p>I have varied my somewhat monotonous life by frequent visits to
the bazaar. Here are to be found not only many specimens of the
fine silk and woollen fabrics for which Tunis is famed, but some of
the beautiful carpets made at Kairwan by the chief ladies of the
holy city, as well as a great number of swords, knives, and
fire-arms of antique make. Oriental bazaars are all very
much<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span> alike, and the
same may be said of the bazaar-keepers; though here the apathy
shown by the dealers as the European, who is a possible customer,
passes, is somewhat strange. No attempt is made to attract the
custom of the infidel, and it would almost appear as though the
shopkeepers would rather not have his money, even if it were to be
offered to them. This is not, however, the case with my friend
Mohamed, who is the chief dealer in curiosities and carpets, and
with whom I have already had many transactions. Mohamed is a very
handsome and intelligent Arab, whose frank and friendly manner
affords a pleasing contrast to that of most of his
fellow-shopkeepers. I suppose that from the nature of his
occupation as a dealer in curios and antiquities he has been
brought into closer contact with Europeans than most of the
Tunisian merchants. At all events, he always looks pleased to see
me, and more than once, through the medium of Afrigan, I have had
an interesting political discussion with him.</p>

<p>I do not go to Mohamed’s, however, to talk politics, but to
endeavour to add to the small store of objects of interest that I
have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span> at home; and
in doing this I have to pass through some very amusing experiences.
In the first place, I find that it takes a long time to buy
anything in Tunis. If one is in a hurry, then farewell to any idea
of securing a bargain. A week or ten days may be easily spent in
the purchase of a single article. In the next place, although
Mohamed is undoubtedly a very honest fellow, you must understand
that he considers it not only his right but his duty to cheat you
if he can. He is there to sell his goods to the best advantage, and
if he can induce you to pay for them three or four times their
value, so much the better for himself. As for your share in a
transaction of this kind, Mohamed will console himself with the
reflection that you are in all probability rich enough to afford to
give sixty francs where you ought only to have given twenty. Both
of these considerations must be borne in mind by the purchaser if
he does not wish to rue his dealings with Mohamed. By keeping them
steadily in view he will probably find that he is able to get what
he wants from that worthy individual at a comparatively moderate
price. For let it be understood that<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_130">[130]</span> Tunis has not yet, happily, been altogether
spoiled by the globe-trotter or the bric-à-brac hunter. You may
still pick up bargains here if you understand how to do it, as well
as gain possession of articles that are really rare and
curious.</p>

<p>The process of purchasing anything at Mohamed’s is, it will be
gathered from what I have said, a somewhat prolonged and
complicated one. After writing my letters and making my usual
morning calls upon Mr. Reade and Messrs. B——— and P———, from whom I
learn the latest news as to the proceedings of the French, I set
off for the bazaar, generally accompanied by Afrigan. Nobody takes
any notice of me as I thread my way through the narrow and crowded
alleys of this great place of merchandise, until I turn into the
particular street where Mohamed has his place of business. Then,
however, a signal of some kind seems to be passed along from shop
to shop until it reaches the spot where my friend conducts his
transactions; for either Mohamed himself will at once come forth to
meet me, or the smart Arab youth who acts as his assistant will
dart away in search of him. In<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_131">[131]</span> either case I shall very soon find myself
seated on a carpet in the narrow entrance to the shop, surrounded
by obsequious Arabs, whining beggars, and curious children who have
come to see the infidel cheated.</p>

<p>At this point it may perhaps be desirable to explain that the
shop of the chief dealer in carpets, silks, and curios in Tunis is
not exactly such a place as is conjured up by the mention of the
name in the mind of the ordinary untravelled Briton. The “shop” is
nothing more than a closet with an open horse-shoe archway facing
the bazaar, through which light is admitted, and ingress or egress
afforded. The closet itself is possibly ten feet in depth and eight
in width: and these, for the bazaar of Tunis, are rather
extravagant dimensions. In front of the horse-shoe archway which
serves both as door and window, are a couple of seats, on which
Mohamed and the customer for the moment can sit cross-legged whilst
they are engaged in the operation of bargaining. Within the shop
the walls are covered with shelving, upon which is packed, in
apparently hopeless confusion, the various fabrics and articles in
which the merchant deals. No<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_132">[132]</span> attempt is made to preserve these articles
from injury during the time they are in Mohamed’s possession. They
are simply stuffed pell-mell into the shelves—scarves, jebbas,
carpets, rugs, turban cloths, curtains, burnouses, being all
squeezed together as closely as possible; whilst knives, pistols,
and rifles are pushed in wherever a vacant corner shows itself.
Probably the stock is worth many thousand pounds; yet the outward
show which is made by it is considerably less than that of a very
ordinary marine-store dealer’s shop in Whitechapel. The tradesmen
of Tunis have not yet, it is evident, learned to appreciate the
value of plate-glass and “dressed” windows. But though they may be
behind their brethren of Europe in some respects, they could teach
them a great deal in certain other matters, notably in the way of
conducting a bargain.</p>

<p>I shake hands cordially with Mohamed, and squat down upon the
carpet-covered bench opposite to him. Cigarettes are produced and
lighted; steaming hot coffee—coffee so fragrant and delicious that
gold could not buy anything like it within the limits of the
British Isles—is brought to us<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_133">[133]</span> in wonderful little cups, and we sip it and
smoke meditatively, whilst I answer the questions Mohamed puts to
me concerning the state of my health, my movements since I saw him
last, and my present opinion respecting M. Roustan, Madame Elias,
and the other delectable people who represent in Tunis the honour
of France and the incorruptibility of M. Gambetta. Then at last we
proceed to business. Mohamed produces a number of particularly
worthless articles—swords, flint-lock guns, inferior silks, &amp;c.
I toss them from me with unconcealed contempt, and prepare to
depart. Mohamed orders more coffee, implores me to resume my seat,
and brings forth from some hidden recess a beautiful curved Moorish
knife, of great antiquity, in a fine sheath covered with arabesque
work in silver. I puff a huge volume of smoke from my cigarette to
hide, if possible, the sudden lighting up of my face at the sight
of this rare and curious article, and say indifferently, “Well,
what do you want for this?” “Ten pounds sterling,” is the immediate
reply. I laugh with the greatest goodhumour, return the knife to
Mohamed, and depart at once, telling<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_134">[134]</span> him I shall come back again when he has
recovered his senses.</p>

<p>The next day, perhaps, I reappear upon the scene; Mohamed rushes
out to meet me, but I pass him with a mere nod, and go on to the
inner bazaar where the goldsmiths are at work in hovels no bigger,
and not much cleaner, than an ordinary pig-sty. In returning,
Mohamed waylays me and insists upon my drinking coffee. Again we
talk on all manner of indifferent subjects; again we look over the
commoner articles of his stock; but nothing is said about the knife
till I am on the point of leaving. “Have you sold that knife yet,
Mohamed?” I say when I have risen. “No; it is here for your honour
still.” “Well, I’ll give you one pound for it.” It is Mohamed’s
turn to laugh now. He holds his hands up in pious horror, and
shouting out, “Ten pounds, not a penny less, for it cost me more
than nine pounds,” he leaves me to go on my way. Another day
passes, and again I find myself squatting on that familiar carpet,
discussing local politics with my worthy friend. I have been buying
from him some of the pretty Tunisian scarfs, embroidered in gold,
and we are in the best<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_135">[135]</span> of humours with each other. Presently I say
to him, “Now, Mohamed, what is your lowest price for that knife?”
“Ten pounds, your honour, as I told you yesterday.” “Look here,
Mohamed, I’m tired of talking to you about that knife. I shall
either buy it now or not at all. If you have nothing else to say,
let us say good-bye, and I’ll go somewhere else.” “Well, I am a
poor man; but I would not like to offend your honour. You shall
have it for six—no, for five pounds: and by the beard of the
prophet! that is less than I gave for it myself.” “Mohamed, I’ll
give you thirty shillings for it, and not one farthing more.” “Oh,
Allah! was ever such a sum named as that? I shall be a ruined man
if I take it. My own sons will mock at me.” I hand my coffee-cup to
an attendant and prepare to go, merely repeating, “Thirty
shillings; not one farthing more.” “Four pounds,” shrieks Mohamed;
“four pounds; and by the beard of the prophet not one farthing
less.” “Good-bye, then, Mohamed; I shall come here no more; may you
prosper without me,” and I step into the ill-paved alley. A bland
smile breaks over Mohamed’s face; he grasps my<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_136">[136]</span> hand and retains me. “What, and do I
really suppose that for such a small matter as this Mohamed would
allow the light of his eyes to depart in anger? The knife is mine,
and a rarer or a finer one he never sold.” The coveted article is
handed over to Afrigan, who slings it round his neck with a
matter-of-fact air; Mohamed and I interchange the friendliest of
salutations, and we part, mutually satisfied, doubtless, with our
respective shares in this comedy in three acts.</p>

<p class="sch">OUTSIDE TUNIS.</p>

<p class="csum">Risks outside the walls — A tantalizing prospect —

— A fine prospect — A visit to the Marsa — Mr. Reade’s
country-house — A country drive — Taib Bey — The fall of Kairwan —
The Bardo — The suzerainty of the Caliph — A quaint custom.</p>

<p><em>Monday, October 24th.</em>—I have spoken of the country
outside Tunis, and of its general characteristics. Excursions to
various places of interest in the neighbourhood of the city have
given me a thorough acquaintance with so much of the locality as it
is possible at present to visit without being exposed to the most
serious risk. To go more than a short distance outside the walls is
at this moment sheer madness. Nothing is more tantalizing than to
see open country roads stretching away into the interior, and to
know that they are absolutely barred against one’s passage by an
enemy, invisible, but still always present, and always ready to
take advantage of the slightest rashness on the part of the
stranger.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span> There is
a particular farm-house standing high up on the hills amid a grove
of prickly pear and cactus, some three miles from the white walls
of the city which has often attracted my attention, and which has
exercised an almost uncontrollable fascination over me. If I were
once up at that point I should not only see what life in a Tunisian
farm-house is like, but I should be able to get a far finer view of
the country than it is possible to obtain anywhere nearer to the
town. The longing to visit the place became so intense the other
day that I was on the point of gratifying it, when word was brought
to me that this very farm-house, nestling so peacefully in a gentle
indentation of the great upland slope that rises behind Tunis, had
been visited the previous day by Arab marauders, who had pillaged
the house and carried off the occupants. What the fate of any
European who chanced to go there just now would be, is more easily
imagined than described; but it is quite certain that my curiosity
as to the country life of the Tunisians must remain for the present
unsatisfied. Still there are one or two favourite drives which I
have taken on several occasions. The<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_139">[139]</span> one that I like best is that to the
Belvedere Hill, lying between Tunis and Carthage, where a French
camp is established.</p>

<p>The whole scene on the road to this camp is wonderfully
picturesque. As you pass out of the arched gateway of the city, you
find yourself in a wide open space caused by the meeting of several
roads from different parts of the country. There is a well here,
and around it may always be seen clustered a large group of horses,
mules, and camels. The soldiers from the camp on the hill, the
white tents of which are plainly visible from the city walls, come
down here with their horses to give them water; or a fatigue party
will arrive for the purpose of carrying the precious liquid up to
the camp. Ragged and wayworn Bedouins from the interior are
lounging about the fountain, or reclining against the huge pillars
of the city gateway, whilst their mules or camels are enjoying a
brief respite from labour, in the midst of the white and dusty
highway. Women and children are begging alms, or are taking those
deep draughts of water from the well which only the dwellers in “a
thirsty land” are able to appreciate. Occasionally a gaily
bedizened<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span> Moor,
with brilliant turban, flowing burnous, and glittering array of
knives and pistols, gallops up, scattering the crowd before him,
and urging his splendidly caparisoned horse to the brink of the
well. The city guards meanwhile, with their burnt faces, ragged
uniforms, and deplorable old rifles, are on duty at the gate, and
eye the passing European with vindictive sullenness of expression.
Is there any other spot within so short a distance of Paris or
London, where scenes like these are to be met with; where one can
find one’s self not only in the midst of an actual campaign, but
surrounded by the typical sights and incidents of a purely Oriental
life?</p>

<p>Our carriage soon leaves this wonderful gathering-place outside
the city walls behind, and after a sharp tug uphill we find
ourselves nearing the French camp. Here, again, there are
picturesque sights in abundance, though of a different order. No
Arabs are to be seen near the encampment, but the Jews, who in
dress so closely resemble them, abound. Many of them have brought
trays of fruit or sweetmeats to the spot, and are conducting a
languid trade with the soldiers.<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_141">[141]</span> Then there are French hucksters, whose
stock-in-trade seems to be a barrel of wine or a few bottles of
beer or absinthe. They have constructed a rude shelter for
themselves from the sun beneath the wide-spreading olive-trees, and
you may always depend upon finding a few gentlemen in blue trousers
sharing the hospitalities they have to dispense. The sobriety of
the French soldier is evidently not incompatible with a very
plentiful consumption of wine and bad spirits. A sentry now bars
our way. He will listen to no explanation; he will take no message
to the commander of the camp, and when one of us shows a slight
disposition to walk past him, unheeding his stern “<em>Il est
défendu, monsieur!</em>” his rifle is instantaneously brought down
to a horizontal position, and his bayonet gleams in unpleasant
proximity to the offender’s breast. But I have a good field-glass
with me, and standing on the little entrenchment thrown up for the
defence of the camp, I can distinctly see every portion of it.
Truth to tell, there is not much to be seen. There are lines of
tents—most of them bell-tents, though here and there the wretched
little <em>tente d’abri</em> is to be seen, and<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span> there are long rows of
soldiers stretched in the shade, sleeping peacefully. Here and
there an orderly may be observed, or a fatigue party armed with
water-buckets, or an officer, carelessly dressed, striding about
with shiftless gait. You can see, too, that the camp is not a
delectable place of residence—far from it. Pheugh! As I look there
comes to me, borne on the breeze, an indescribable odour. I have
experienced something like it before, frequently in a travelling
menagerie; but only once before did I actually encounter this
horrible and insufferable stench. That was more than ten years ago,
in the gardens at Versailles, when my evil genius prompted me to
look over the balustrades into the Orangerie below, where the
captured Communists were herded together like caged wild beasts. It
is not an odour to be forgotten. It seems to print the word
“Typhus” in big legible letters upon the luminous atmosphere.</p>

<p>I turn away from the camp, and survey the lovely country which
is spread out at my feet like a map—for it is not without reason
that this hill is called the Belvedere. There lies the white city,
with its multitudinous flat roofs, its labyrinth of narrow streets,
its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span> quaint ungainly
towers, and its Kasbah, on which flies the French flag. Beyond it
you see the semicircle of forts which at once defend it and command
it. On these also flies the tricolour. Then there are the great
ranges of hill, sweeping away to where the jagged peaks of the
Zaghouan Mountains intercept one’s view, and the lake immediately
below me dotted with the white sails of the fishermen, and in the
distance the amphitheatre where once stood Carthage, and the blue
waters of the Gulf. The whole scene is bathed in the brilliant
sunshine of Africa. One has no wish, after feasting one’s eyes upon
it, to resume one’s study of the interior of the French camp.</p>

<p>One day—that ought to be marked with a red letter in this
discursive journal—I accepted an invitation from Mr. Reade to go
with him to his country house at the Marsa. We travelled together
by the mid-day train from Tunis, B——— and P——— accompanying us.
After leaving Goletta the line turns to the west, and runs forward
to the Arab town of Sidi bou Said. But before we reached the
terminus the whistle sounded, and the train suddenly stopped. I
looked out. We were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
in the middle of a beautiful and trimly kept garden. There was a
platform of gravel, and in the centre of it a neat summer-house,
but no other sign to indicate that this was an ordinary station. It
was, in fact, the private station alloted to Mr. Reade, and it was
his garden in which we had stopped. We descended from the train and
were met by four or five bright English lads—the sons of Mr. Reade
and of one of my companions. How strangely their talk, the talk of
English schoolboys, sounded amid these unfamiliar scenes! We
strolled up a beautiful avenue of cypress, date-palms, and cactus,
to the house. It is a Moorish villa of noble architecture.
Ascending a broad sweep of marble stairs in front, we found
ourselves upon a splendid verandah, with screen of exquisite
Moorish arches, and tiled walls and floor. This lovely covered
terrace was cool and airy in spite of the intense heat of the day;
and even without regarding the fine view which was to be had from
it, one could understand how in the nine months’ summer of Tunis it
was the favourite sitting-room and place of assembly of the family.
A door opening from this verandah gave admittance to a vast
and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span> lofty hall, the
walls of which were also lined with tiles; whilst beyond were
suites of large rooms, furnished rather in the Moorish than the
European style. Of the warm and graceful hospitality with which I
was received by the lady of the house this is not the place in
which to speak. It may not, however, be out of place to mention
that I now for the first time had the opportunity of tasting
<em>couscousoo</em>, the national dish of the Arabs. Most excellent
it is, though it has perhaps the fault of satisfying one’s appetite
rather too quickly. It is a preparation of semolina, meat, and
herbs, and has all the characteristics of a very fine curry with
added excellences that are peculiar to itself. Perhaps the nearest
approach to the dish is the <em>pilaff</em> which you get in
Turkey; but between <em>couscousoo</em> and either curry or
<em>pilaff</em> there is one great difference. That is, that in the
Arab dish rice is not an ingredient, semolina, or whole grains of
wheat, prepared in some peculiar fashion, taking its place. My
introduction to <em>couscousoo</em> was of such a character that I
became straightway desirous to renew the acquaintance at the
earliest possible moment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>After our
mid-day meal—which formed in all respects a delightful contrast to
the dismal and painful experiences in the gastronomic line which I
had been hitherto passing through in Tunis—I went for a drive with
Mr. Reade. In the course of this drive we got a splendid view of
the Gulf and the surrounding country, including the entire site of
Carthage. The dusty lanes lined on either side with hedges of
cactus, prickly pear, and other tropical plants, presented a
strange contrast to the scenery amid which the ordinary afternoon
drive of an Englishman is enjoyed. We passed great numbers of
Arabs. None of them took the slightest notice of Mr. Reade, though
all must have known him, and must have been aware that he had
proved himself to be in many ways their benefactor and protector.
Returning to the house, we lounged on the verandah smoking,
chatting, and watching the boys at their play—the garden ringing
with their shouts and laughter. Then, after a delightful cup of
English tea, we started for the little garden station. It was broad
daylight when we left the house; but before Mr. Reade and I had
strolled the length of the avenue it was<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_147">[147]</span> almost dark, so swiftly does night fall in
these latitudes. I noticed in the garden a lamp burning amid the
thick boughs of a large tree or shrub, and inquired the meaning of
its appearance there. It seems that the tree on which the lamp is
hung is sacred in the estimation of the Arabs, who believe that a
saint of peculiar holiness is buried beneath it. Accordingly this
lamp is lighted every Thursday night in honour of the pious man,
and devout Mohammedans come and pray beneath the shade of the tree.
It is on the whole well for them that an Englishman happens to be
the occupant of this house and the master of the beautiful garden.
The kindliness which leads Mr. Reade to respect the shrine of which
he has thus accidentally become the possessor, and not only to
respect it, but to allow free access to it on the part of the
people of the country, is somewhat different from the disposition
shown by the nation which is about to add the proud name of Kairwan
to the list of its conquests!</p>

<p>The day after my visit to the beautiful country home of the
English Consul-General, I had another opportunity of seeing an
interior<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span> at the
Marsa. The Marsa, I ought here to explain, is not so much a village
as a circumscribed district in which are gathered together the
villas of many of the wealthiest and most important members both of
the European and native communities. Thus M. Roustan has, like Mr.
Reade, a country house here; and here also are the palaces of the
brothers of the reigning Bey. It was to pay a visit to Taib Bey,
the younger brother of the Bey, that I went to the Marsa on this
occasion. That Taib is mixed up in many of the political intrigues
of which the Regency is at present the scene, and that he would not
be at all sorry to supplant his brother, is, I believe, perfectly
true. The standard of morals prevailing here is—well, I think it
will be better to call it Tunisian; and if all that I have heard,
not only about the Bey and his brothers, but about many other
distinguished people in Tunis, is to be trusted, the world would
not lose much if an earthquake were to bring the whole Regency to
destruction to-morrow. Mr. Levy, the gentleman whose claim to the
Enfida estate is one of the causes that are said to have led up to
the French invasion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
of the country, acted as my guide in this visit to Taib Bey, in
which the principal part was played by my friend Mr. B———. Taib, it
appears, was anxious to influence the English public on his behalf;
hence his invitation to us. It was the first time that I had ever
been honoured by being received by the brother of a reigning
Sovereign, and perhaps I ought to have felt more impressed than I
did with the greatness of the occasion; but as a matter of fact it
is a little difficult for an Englishman to enter into all the
niceties of Tunisian dignities—almost as difficult as it is for him
to understand the feeling of delight with which the Frenchmen here,
who have been decorated with the Order of the Bey, display upon
their manly bosoms the vast pewter plate which is the chief of the
insignia of that Order.</p>

<p>Mr. Levy’s three horses, harnessed abreast, made comparatively
short work of the journey from Tunis to the Marsa. We found
ourselves precisely at the appointed hour entering the large,
rambling Moorish villa, situated in the midst of a pleasant garden,
which is the residence of the illustrious Taib Bey. Half way up the
garden we were met<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
by the Bey’s secretary, a swarthy Arab, clad in gay yellow robes,
richly embroidered. He conducted us through an inner court, in the
middle of which a fountain was playing, into a small sitting-room,
where the Bey’s son-in-law, a Turk, greeted us in the most friendly
fashion. Here coffee was served in the usual manner, in delicate
porcelain cups, placed in elaborately chased silver holders.
Presently a good-looking boy of twelve or thirteen came to announce
that the Bey awaited us. We were ushered up a narrow tiled
staircase, and through an antechamber into a large apartment, where
we found the Bey seated on a sofa. It would be doing violence to
the truth if I were to say that the appearance of his Highness was
prepossessing. His manners, it is true, were pleasant, and he was
evidently anxious to put himself on friendly terms with us; nor can
it be said that he lacked intelligence. But no one could mistake
the meaning of the flabby chin, the loose and puffy cheeks, the
watery eye, and lean and trembling fingers. The sensuality which is
the curse of these Arab potentates had evidently broken his
manhood. There was,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
too, a furtive cunning in his glance that put one instinctively
upon one’s guard.</p>

<p>Taib Bey may be, as he professes, a better man than his brother;
but he is not a man in whose mercy I, for one, should care to find
myself. Of his conversation with us, carried on through the medium
of an interpreter, and lasting for some twenty minutes, I need not
say much. It was chiefly directed against the reigning Bey, the
ex-Prime Minister, Mustapha, and M. Roustan. If the truth must be
told, I was more interested in what I saw than in what I heard; and
as Europeans are seldom admitted to the houses of these Arab
princes, I was anxious to make the best use of my time whilst
there. All the rooms which I saw were very poorly furnished, but
the curtains, sofa covers, &amp;c., were of clean and pretty
chintz. The ornaments, even in the large apartment in which we were
received, and which was evidently the chief reception-room of the
house, were the tawdriest paper flowers, placed under common glass
shades. The only things to be seen which were really rare or
curious of their kind were two tall clocks at the foot of each
staircase. These<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
were very fine, and with all the ardour of a bric-à-brac hunter I
felt half-inclined to sound Taib’s secretary as to the possibility
of my purchasing one of them. I managed to resist the inclination,
however; and perhaps it was just as well that I did so, as, unless
rumour libels him, his Highness has a decidedly unpleasant way of
making his anger felt when any one chances to displease him.</p>

<p><em>Friday, October 28th.</em>—We received this morning the news
of the entry of the French into the sacred city of Kairwan. Mr.
Levy was the first to bring the intelligence, which was speedily
confirmed. Nothing, however, was known of it among the inhabitants
of Tunis, so that the excitement which may be expected to arise
when it becomes known that “the Sacred City” is in the hands of the
infidel has not yet been shown. I accompanied B——— this afternoon
on one of the most interesting expeditions to be made at present
outside the walls of Tunis—that to the Bardo Palace. The Bardo is
the St. James’s of Tunis—the official palace, that is to say, where
in ordinary times the work of the Government is carried on; where
the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span> Bey administers
justice in the primitive fashion still adhered to in this quarter
of the world, where he holds his audiences, &amp;c. Near to it is
his private palace, where he actually lives when at “the Bardo.” As
for the Bardo itself, it is a walled town rather than a single
building or group of buildings. In front is a wide, open space, in
the middle of which a fountain is playing; whilst a row of rusty
cannon, placed along the line of a dry ditch, are the ostensible
defence of the palace. Driving along the road to the Bardo, which
lies between two and three miles from Tunis, we encountered many
trains of laden camels, and scores of Arabs cantering along on
their mules. There were French patrols too passing up and down the
road; for this is the route to Manouba, where the principal French
camp and military hospital are situated. Passing through the
exterior gateway of the palace—after having shown the pass kindly
obtained for me by Mr. Reade—I found myself in a street in which
there were coffee shops, shops for the sale of domestic utensils,
and even a post-office. All the walls were whitewashed somewhat
after the fashion used in English<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_154">[154]</span> barracks, but everywhere signs of decay and
neglect were visible, even the Bey’s flag which fluttered over the
principal gateway showing an ugly rent.</p>

<p>After passing through two courtyards, in one of which was a
fountain with fine marble columns, we alighted at the foot of the
great staircase, which is guarded by lions in marble. At the top of
the staircase is a large open verandah, with splendid pillars of
marble or porphyry, brought from Carthage; and it was curious to
observe on one of these the emblematic serpent, which carried one’s
mind back to the days of the Phœnicians. From this verandah
entrance is obtained to the central court of the Bardo and to the
throne-room, where every Saturday during the winter the Bey is in
the habit, of hearing the complaints of his subjects and
administering justice in the quaint patriarchal fashion of the
East. From the door of this throne-room, every evening from time
immemorial it has been customary to proclaim the titles of the
Sultan in recognition of his suzerainty as Caliph. Even now, when
the French occupy Tunis, and the last shred of Ottoman authority
has disappeared,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
this custom is kept up; and this afternoon, before leaving the
palace, I was fortunate enough to witness the quaint and striking
ceremony. Before doing so, however, I inspected the palace
itself.</p>

<p>The first room to which I was admitted was a small but
gorgeously decorated private reception-room. Gold was used lavishly
in the adornment of the ceilings and walls; on the floor was
stretched a handsome but somewhat faded Axminster carpet, the gift
of the Queen of England, and the chairs were all in scarlet and
gold. This apartment may be called the business-room of the Bey,
that in which he sees his Ministers, the Consuls, and others who
have official work to transact with him. Adjoining it was a very
pleasant chamber, with a glass window running the whole length of
the room, and affording a fine view of the Manouba road, on which
the French patrols could be seen passing. On the walls some quaint
portraits of the former Sultans of Turkey were hung. Passing up a
very ordinary staircase, I was admitted to the great room of the
palace, which in size is a really magnificent apartment, in this
respect rivalling that ball-room<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_156">[156]</span> in the palace at Amsterdam which I saw a
few weeks ago, and which was described to me as the finest room in
Europe. The furniture of this great room is very tawdry, and in
spite of its size and the canopied throne which stands at one end,
it has a mean and squalid appearance. There are hundreds of fine
chandeliers holding dirty wax candles at every angle save the right
one. The walls are adorned by life-size portraits of many of the
sovereigns of Europe, presented to the Bey. The Queen of England is
merely represented by a small engraving, and the Bey is said to be
very indignant at her Majesty’s having omitted to send him her
portrait in oil. The finest thing in the room is a wonderful piece
of Gobelins tapestry—a portrait of Louis Philippe. This is really
remarkable for colour, fineness of outline, and general effect. At
a short distance it is impossible to distinguish it from an oil
painting.</p>

<p>My visit to the palace, where dirt reigned supreme, and signs of
decay and neglect were everywhere to be met with, would have been
most disappointing if I had not been privileged to see the ceremony
of proclaiming the Sultan’s titles of which I have spoken.
This<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span> was a most
curious and interesting performance. A melancholy-looking man in
tattered garments, beating a large drum, like himself considerably
the worse for wear, crossed the courtyard, and, climbing the lion
staircase, took up his position in front of the door of the
throne-room. He was followed by a second performer on a kind of
flute, from which he drew forth weird and ear-piercing strains. The
door was thrown open, and two old heralds in scarlet and gold took
their places on either side of it. Then, when the musical
performance, which had lasted some considerable time, had ceased,
one of the heralds, a venerable Turk, proclaimed in Turkish—and
apparently by a series of dismal howls which reverberated through
the corridors and courtyards of the palace—the titles and glories
of the Sultan. It was a curious and memorable incident for one to
witness in the middle of that crumbling building, outside of which
the French troops were passing, all unconscious of what was
happening within. Does M. Gambetta know, I wonder, that this formal
declaration of the Caliph’s suzerainty is still kept up at the
Bardo in spite of the treaties and despatches of the ingenuous M.
Saint-Hilare?</p>

<p class="less space-above15"><span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_158">[158]</span>[Since I wrote the foregoing account of Taib
Bey, he has undergone a very remarkable change of circumstances. In
January last Taib’s palace was suddenly surrounded by Tunisian
cavalry, and the unfortunate Prince, dragged from his bed, was made
captive and carried off to the Bardo, where they have a very easy
way of getting rid of criminals or of those who happen to be
obnoxious to the authorities. In the meantime Taib’s son, or more
probably his son-in-law, who acted as master of his household, is
reported to have escaped and taken refuge in the country house of
Mr. Reade. These events will show my readers how different life in
Tunis is from life in Europe. The beautiful villa at the Marsa,
where I spent a delightful day last October, is now the sanctuary
in which a hunted man has found a refuge under the shelter of the
English flag; whilst Taib Bey’s palace stands desolate, and its
owner is the occupant of a prison. The real reason for Taib’s
arrest is that he refused to give a bribe of large amount which was
demanded by a friend of M. Roustan, and that he offered to produce
documents proving the criminality of Roustan and his connexion with
a notorious adventuress. For these reasons he has now been made
prisoner at the instigation of M. Roustan, and is in great danger
of losing his life. That he has intrigued against his brother is
perfectly true; but it is equally certain that his brother has not
himself been willing to order his arrest. The information I have
received on high authority from Tunis, since the arrest took place,
is to the effect that the Bey was most unwilling to take any
proceedings, and that it was M. Roustan who forced this particular
measure upon him.]</p>

<p class="sch">ON THE ROAD TO KAIRWAN.</p>

<p class="csum">The story of a failure — Friendly warnings —
Uxorious Afrigan — A change of diet — I start for Susa — An African
thunderstorm — Susa — Troublous times — A busy scene — A miniature
railway — The English Vice-Consul — Preparations for camping-out —
A new servant — Disappointed — A “Parisian Hotel” in the Gulf of
Hammamet — A risky expedition — A faithful follower.</p>

<p><em>Susa, Tuesday, November 1st.</em>—The story of a failure is
not the most pleasant reading in the world; and alas! the history
of my attempt to get to Kairwan is the history of a failure. I
found myself within less than forty miles of the famous Sacred
City, “the Mecca of the West,”—I was <em>nearly</em> there; and I
was beaten back by the force of circumstances over which I had no
control. Still the account of my journey towards Kairwan is one
which contains sufficient elements of interest to be worth
repeating here. For some days I had been hanging on at Tunis,
waiting for the moment when news should come that the French had
reached Kairwan.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
Until they had done so, it would, of course, have been sheer
madness to attempt a journey to the place. On Friday, October 28th,
however, the news that the French columns had reached Kairwan and
that the tricolour had been hoisted on the tower of the great
Mosque reached Tunis, and I immediately prepared to start. It was
amusing to listen to the dismal prophecies uttered on all sides
regarding the certain fate of those who ventured to tread in the
footsteps of the French army. My friend Mohamed in the bazaar shook
his head dolefully when he heard I was going, and declared that
even he would not be safe in Kairwan. The fanatics of that holy
city were so intensely excited against all who had bowed the knee
to the infidel, that they were prepared to fall upon any of the
Arabs of Tunis, and to slay them for having permitted their
venerable city, “the Burnous of the Prophet,” to be defiled by a
foreign occupation.</p>

<p>I suggested to Mohamed that inasmuch as the Kairwan people now
lay under the same condemnation, they might perhaps look more
leniently upon the offences of himself and his brethren. But he
shook his head in a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>
doleful fashion, and pressing my hand warmly, commended me to the
protection of Allah, as one who was about to go through a den of
wild beasts. My next difficulty was with Afrigan. He had served me
so faithfully and diligently hitherto, that I felt loth to part
from him. “Will you go to Kairwan with me?” I demanded of him as we
sat and smoked our cigarettes under the delicious sky of an African
night, in front of a little café of which I had become a
frequenter. “Well, you see, sir,” said he, with Scotch
indirectness, “I have a wife.” “But what of that? I may have one
also, and yet I am going.” “Ah, sir, you <em>may</em> have a wife,”
said Afrigan, in a tone which implied the profoundest incredulity
upon the point; “but she’s a long way off, so it doesn’t matter.
You see, sir, my wife is in Tunis.” “And you won’t go, then?”
“Well, sir, I am afraid she would not let me.” After this, argument
of course was useless. I confined myself to inviting him to
accompany me at least as far as Susa, whither I was to proceed by
sea. Now, even at Susa, life is by no means safe. Indeed, constant
reports had reached Tunis during my sojourn there<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span> of the shooting of Europeans
in the streets of the town; and it was notorious that Arab raiders
had cleared the country up to the very walls of the city. Afrigan,
however, was quite ready to go with me to Susa; and forthwith I
despatched him to pack a small portmanteau, whilst I made a few
farewell calls upon French and English friends.</p>

<p>The next day there was a great disappointment. It was the day on
which I ought to have started, and I had taken passages for myself
and my servant. Suddenly news was brought to me that the steamer
could not start for another day. It was a bitter termination to my
hopes of getting to Kairwan, and it required all my philosophy to
get over it. On that particular day, I may here mention, I and my
two friends, B——— and P———, found ourselves so sick of the vile
hotel fare, that we induced Montellacci, the Italian pastry-cook of
the European quarter, to prepare us a meal of tinned soups and
meats. It was a welcome change from the <em>menu</em> of the Grand
Hotel, for we at least knew what it was that we were eating; and
though perhaps Montellacci was a little puzzled by our preferring
preserved hare soup<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>
and minced collops to the dainties of the table d’hôte, he did his
best to satisfy us. We felt quite at home as we ate. How strange,
too, is the power of association! As we were lunching in the
confectioner’s shop there fell upon our ears the sound of music.
Music, it should be understood, is almost the only form of
recreation in which the people of Tunis are able to indulge. There
is, however, no theatre—it was burnt down some weeks ago—and no
concert-room; so that the musicians are compelled to wander from
café to café, trusting to the liberality of the frequenters of
those places for their reward. On this occasion it was a couple of
Neapolitans, with violin and flute, who favoured us with the
strains of a gay Neapolitan fisher’s song. Suddenly they passed
from this to one more familiar to me; and hackneyed and vulgar
though the melody was, it touched me in a curious way to hear the
well-known “Grandfather’s Clock” performed there, in the narrow
street where the Arabs were walking to and fro, and the innumerable
dogs were playing their part as scavengers.</p>

<p>A night’s reflection brought me to the conclusion that I would
go to Susa even now, and<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_164">[164]</span> take my chance when there of getting on to
Kairwan. Accordingly, on the next afternoon, having provided myself
with a letter of introduction to the English Vice-Consul at Susa,
Mr. Gallia, I set off with Afrigan for Goletta. By five o’clock I
was on board a magnificent vessel of the Compagnie Transatlantique,
the <em>Ville de Naples</em>. This is a sister ship to the
<em>Charles Quint</em>, and, like the latter, was built upon the
Clyde. It is, however, somewhat larger than the <em>Charles
Quint</em>, and, if anything, is even more gorgeously appointed. As
I was being rowed off to the place where the <em>Ville de
Naples</em> lay at anchor, I passed close to the English gunboat
<em>Falcon</em>, Captain Selby. The sailors were just being piped
to tea, and it was right pleasant to see so many “jolly Jacks” of
my own country and to hear once more the strains of an English
bugle. Nor was it less pleasant to find oneself again on board a
clean and well-appointed French boat, on which one could exchange
the filth and bad food of Tunis for something like civilized
cookery. There was some delay in making a start, and it was not
until long after we had dined that the anchor was weighed. But I
shall never forget that<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_165">[165]</span> interval of waiting. All round us were the
merchant-vessels and men-of-war gathered together in the safe
anchorage of the gulf; whilst in the distance were the low ranges
of hills, and the white and spectral towers of Tunis and Goletta. A
change had taken place in the weather immediately after sunset. For
the first time since my arrival it became, not cold, but cool. And
now the most terrific storm of lightning I had ever witnessed
suddenly burst around us. This African lightning is at once
magnificent and terrible to behold. It played all over the surface
of sea and land, in wonderful, tremulous flashes of the most
intense violet. There was literally no interval between these
flashes; and I saw further inland under their penetrating glare
than I could have done in the sunshine. Even after the anchor had
been raised and we had got well on our way in the Mediterranean,
the lightning seemed to be following us, lighting up the crests of
the waves, and throwing the rugged coast-line out in splendid
relief.</p>

<p>The next morning, going on deck I found the ship running into
the deep gulf at the bottom of which lies Susa. The Zaghouan hills
were almost as distinctly visible here as<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_166">[166]</span> they had been at Tunis, though it was at
the other side of them that I now looked. Presently on the port
quarter we sighted Monastir, an important centre of the trade in
olive oil; and then Susa was opened up to us right ahead. It would
be difficult to imagine a pleasanter-looking town than Susa—when
seen at a distance. Built in a parallelogram, with high white walls
running completely round it, and a huge kasbah or citadel
dominating it in the background, it presents a most pleasing aspect
from the sea. The country is much more fertile here than it is in
the neighbourhood of Tunis; a rich belt of olive forest running
along the seacoast, and many handsome Moorish villas and
farm-houses nestling between the trees and the shore of the bay.
Looking beyond the town inland, I saw ranges of sandhills of
curious shape. Beyond these sandhills stretches a marshy desert
reaching far into the interior. Riding at anchor in the harbour
were two French ships of war, an Italian gunboat, and my old friend
the <em>Charles Quint</em>! After breakfasting on board—a most
“happy thought,” as I subsequently discovered—I landed under the
walls of the town. These<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_167">[167]</span> walls, it ought to be explained, run right
along the beach as well as on the other sides of the city, so that
the latter is completely closed in. How necessary such defence is,
may be gathered from the fact that within the past six weeks every
villa or farm-house outside the walls, including even those which
are only a few hundred yards from the gates, has been pillaged by
the insurgent Arabs. So near have these gentlemen ventured to the
town that—as I subsequently found by unpleasant experience—it is
dangerous even to walk or ride fifty yards beyond the walls.</p>

<p>Susa being the starting-point of one of the columns which has
marched upon Kairwan, and being also the base of supply for the
whole French army in that part of the country, is at this moment
the scene of immense activity. No one landing here can fail to
perceive that he is in a country in which an active campaign is
being carried on. On the beach enormous quantities of
<em>matériel</em> of all kinds are gathered, and the big
flat-bottomed boats are ever bringing fresh supplies from the ships
in the harbour. Arab labourers and French soldiers, mingled
together in a picturesque crowd, are all talking wildly,
rushing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span> hither and
thither, and generally doing the best they can to obstruct one
another. It is amusing to contrast the shrill tones of the French
with that extraordinary guttural sound which represents spoken
Arabic, and which has for all the world so strong a similarity to
the “gobble-gobble” of an infuriated turkey. The Arabs in Susa, or
rather, here on the beach in the midst of the French transport
department, seemed to have been roused from their ordinary apathy.
I even saw some of them running, and one or two of them were
evidently excited. Threading my way through the great mounds of
grain and coffee bags, I came upon the starting-point of the little
Decauville railway, which is being laid down to serve the army at
Kairwan. The last time I saw one of these miniature locomotives was
in the Steam Plough Works at Leeds. The railway to Kairwan starts
from the beach, or rather from the yard of Messrs. Perry, Bury, and
Co., an English firm engaged in the esparto grass trade, for whom
Mr. Gallia, our Vice-Consul, acts as agent. It is as yet only
completed to a point about twelve miles from Susa, and has to be
constantly watched by patrols, in order to prevent its being
destroyed by the Arabs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>Passing through
a deep vaulted gateway, more like a tunnel than an ordinary
entrance gate, and then through a second which was in the
occupation of French soldiers in soiled and ragged uniforms, I
found myself in the town itself. There was a labyrinth of narrow,
ill-paved streets, along which one had to pick one’s way with the
utmost care. A few Maltese coffee-houses, where vile adulterated
spirits were being sold to the sailors and soldiers, and here and
there a melancholy little shop, alone broke in upon the depressing
monotony of the blank white walls, which here, as in Tunis, line
the streets for the greater part of the way. After feasting one’s
eyes upon the fair exterior of the city, it was indeed a
disillusionment to enter it. With some little difficulty Afrigan
and I found our way to the English Vice-Consulate, where Mr.
Gallia, the son of an Italian father and of an English mother, was
engaged in transacting business in a vaulted apartment, which would
have looked like nothing so much as a stable or a cellar if it had
not been for the beautiful tiles with which floor and walls were
lined. Here I was received with kindness on the presentation of my
letter of introduction. “Is it possible to get to<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span> Kairwan?” I asked.
“Certainly,” was the answer, given with a businesslike promptitude
to which I was quite unaccustomed in the Regency. “A French convoy
will leave here at three o’clock this afternoon; you must get a
pass and go with it, and you will be there in three days.”</p>

<p>I was delighted to find how the dangers, of which I had heard so
much when in Tunis, seemed to have vanished as I approached them,
and instantly prepared to go. But there was still much to be done
before I could consider myself equipped for a journey which,
counting the return journey, would last at least a week, and during
the whole of which I should have to be entirely dependent upon my
own resources both for food and for shelter. A thick Arab burnous,
and a splendid fez, or <em>sheshia</em>, as it is called here, were
procured for me by Afrigan; the English hat I wore being wholly
unsuited to the climate. I may say here that no greater mistake
than that of taking a very light hat into such a country as Africa
can be committed. The head must have sufficient covering to protect
it from the fierce rays of the sun. It was curious indeed to
observe that when the heat was greatest in<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_171">[171]</span> Tunis, the Arabs seemed to wear their
thickest clothes and biggest turbans. After attending to these
necessaries of dress, I engaged, on Gallia’s recommendation, a
servant to replace Afrigan. A glance at the man showed that I had
made a change for the worse. He was a Maltese, who spoke Arabic,
Italian, and a little English, and was described to me by the
faithful Consul as “not quite right in his head, and given to
drink, but fairly honest.” He was, however, the only man who seemed
willing to risk his life in a journey to Kairwan, so I was
compelled to put up with him. Then a mule and a donkey had to be
hired, and some sixty francs’ worth of tinned meats and bread
bought, whilst knives, pannikins, a lantern, and some candles
completed my outfit.</p>

<p>It was no light matter to have to rush about the streets of Susa
making these purchases under the blazing mid-day sun. Afrigan,
whose heart was evidently heavy at parting from me, did his best,
and his dull successor was quite willing to suggest the most
incredible purchases of meat for the journey. I saw his eyes
glisten as each successive tin was added to the store I was
collecting, and I thought ruefully of the share which he
would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span> undoubtedly
claim for himself when the moment to divide these good things
should arrive.</p>

<p>At last, panting and exhausted, I returned to the Vice-Consul’s
to report the completion of my equipment. Alas! the first words
that greeted me were an announcement that Mr. Gallia had been
mistaken, and that the convoy had started at one instead of three
o’clock. I suggested that I might easily overtake it, as it
consisted of some hundreds of laden camels. He laughed at the
notion. Even the half-hour’s start it had obtained was fatal to my
chance of joining it. To go without armed escort beyond the city
walls was to court attack. I did not credit this alarming statement
at the moment; but a few hours later, when by an unpleasant
experience of my own I had ascertained in a practical manner the
presence of insurgent Arabs within a few hundred yards of the city
gates, in the belt of olive wood outside the walls, I was compelled
to give the Vice-Consul credit for having spoken the literal
truth.</p>

<p>Of the miseries of the enforced sojourn at Susa which I had now
to face I shall not say much. I parted with Afrigan, who went on
board the <em>Ville de Naples</em>, which had been<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span> appointed to return to Tunis
the same evening. Mr. Gallia had informed me that Susa had lately
been blessed with a luxury, a “real Parisian hotel,” and thither I
went to take up my quarters until the convoy for Kairwan should
start, an event which we understood would take place on the
following day. A real Parisian hotel! It was situated in an old
Arab house, opposite the great mosque of Susa, an extraordinary
building, of which I shall have something more to say presently. I
subsequently found that this house was the property of Mr. Levy of
the Enfida, who had let it recently to an enterprising Frenchwoman
from Marseilles, who had come to Susa in the wake of the French
army. The filth left behind by the last Arab occupants of the place
apparently still remained undisturbed. A few articles of European
furniture, a long wooden table, and a dozen cane-bottomed chairs
had been put into one of the rooms, which by the process had been
converted into a <em>salle-à-manger</em>. I asked to see a bedroom,
and was led up a slippery outside staircase to a gallery from which
the various sleeping apartments were entered. The furniture of that
into which I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span> was
shown consisted of an old iron bedstead on which a bag stuffed with
shavings was placed, a small table, and a three-legged stool. The
tiled floor was thick with filth, and the heavily barred windows
refused to open. However, there was shelter here from the sun, and
though I had my suspicions as to the contents of that bag of
shavings, it was at least possible to rest one’s weary legs upon
it, whilst I covered all the native odours of the apartment with
the grateful fumes of tobacco. After a while, too, I got a basin
containing some water, so that I was fain to confess that
civilization had indeed achieved a triumph in Susa when this “Grand
Hôtel de France” was set up there.</p>

<p>I had invited the Vice-Consul to dine with me, and I scraped up
an acquaintance with the landlady in order to secure her interest
on the side of a good dinner. I knew the dinner would be the
reverse of good; I knew that in such a place it must be detestably,
execrably bad, but I was in hopes that there might be a little good
wine in the house. Well, there was wine—champagne at fifteen and
Bordeaux at ten francs a bottle. I hoped that my guest, if he could
not eat the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span> food,
would at least be able to drink. Then, having done my best in
preparation for dinner, I went for a walk—or rather a ride—to the
outskirts of the town. It was then that I discovered that the Arabs
were somewhat closer to the walls than I had anticipated. Nothing
but an ignominious flight sufficed to save me from a fate which
would have prevented any pages of this diary ever seeing the light
of day. My little adventure satisfied me upon one point, and that
was as to the thorough untrustworthiness of my new domestic. As
soon as he saw me approaching danger, he simply turned and fled
without a word of warning, leaving me to face the consequences for
myself. And very unpleasant those consequences might have been!
However, I got back safely into the town, and once more went to see
Mr. Gallia. He took me for a walk through the streets into the
little bazaar—a very bad copy of that of Tunis, though arranged
upon the same plan, with the slipper-makers in one street, the
perfumers in another, the vendors of linen in a third, &amp;c. A
curious crowd of Arabs followed us, and watched all my proceedings
with the liveliest interest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>Then we strolled
down to the beach and to the office of the harbour-master, where we
sat drinking the hottest of coffee, and looking out upon the
beautiful bay, so tranquil and lovely in the light of the setting
sun. Suddenly the clouds overcast the sky, and the dust began to
rise in volumes so dense as to make it almost impossible to
breathe. Then, almost in an instant, the temperature fell many
degrees, the rain began to fall in heavy drops, and a cold wind
blew round us. We hastened back to the miserable shelter of my
hotel; stumbling along the streets where the patient camels were
sheltering themselves against the walls, and their drivers with
their robes wrapped about their faces were endeavouring to screen
themselves from the blinding dust. As we strode onward, no very
lively feelings animating my breast, I heard a well-known voice
behind me, and looked round. It was Afrigan! The faithful fellow
had ascertained that his steamer would not start that night, and
although I had now set him at liberty, he had returned from the
comfortable vessel to share the miseries of a sojourn in Susa with
me. With his aid<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span> my
bedroom at the “Grand Hotel” was made at least a little cleaner
than when I took possession of it.</p>

<p>In due time the dinner-hour arrived, and with it my guest. The
dinner was even worse than I had anticipated; and I made haste to
draw Mr. Gallia’s attention to the wine, hoping thus to divert it
from the viands. Alas! he assured me that he had been a teetotaler
from his birth. “And have you then no vices?” I asked. “Ah, yes; I
have two very serious ones. I drink too much coffee, and that you
know is thought quite as bad here as drinking too much wine; and I
am always smoking cigars—when I can get them.” The latter statement
was reassuring. I had just secured, before leaving the <em>Ville de
Naples</em>, a packet of five-and-twenty Algerian cigars. I hastily
drew them from my pocket, and almost before the keenest pangs of
hunger had been satisfied, we pushed away our plates and began to
smoke. I am afraid to say how many of those cigars were left when,
after a most interesting talk respecting affairs in Tunis, my
friend left me shortly before midnight.</p>

<p class="sch">A GALE OFF CAPE BON.</p>

<p class="csum">A night of misery — No chance of seeing Kairwan —
The Great Mosque of Susa — The Vice-Consul’s house — An English
captive in Susa — Arab revolvers — Old friends — On board the
<em>Ville de Naples</em> — A disturbed meal — Running for shelter —
Rounding Cape Bon — Glasgow for ever!</p>

<p><em>November 3rd.</em>—I have passed some miserable nights in
the course of my life, but not many to be compared in absolute
wretchedness with that which it was my lot to spend under the roof
of the French hotel of Susa. Perhaps some of those nights that I
passed some years ago in the detestable gasthof of the detestable
town of Mohacs, Lower Hungary, may have been as bad as this; but
distance lends enchantment to the view, and from my quarters at
Susa I looked with longing eyes even towards the mud huts on the
swampy banks of the Danube, where I had once sojourned in
wretchedness. It was bitterly cold, so that as I lay upon a bed of
shavings, wrapped<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>
closely in my camel’s hair burnous, I was chilled to the very
marrow. The wind was howling round the corners of the house, and
shrieking across the great open roof of the adjoining mosque, and
the rain was beating heavily upon the window. As I lay there and
thought of the six or seven nights I must spend in the open, with
no better shelter than my cloak, whilst I made the journey to
Kairwan, I confess that I did not feel in a particularly cheerful
frame of mind. But far worse than wind or rain or gloomy thoughts
was the Egyptian plague which tormented me within the walls of my
chamber. Mosquitoes boomed about my devoted head all night long;
and from the bag of shavings on which I lay came forth an army of
creeping things to prey upon my flesh. How I longed for morning!
When at last it came I rose quite unrefreshed, and performed my
ablutions as well as I was able in the small basin of water which I
had managed to secure on the previous evening. The room, I need
hardly say, was innocent of such an article as a looking-glass; so
that my toilette was completed under difficulties. There were two
windows to the apartment,<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_180">[180]</span> and both were heavily barred by means of
that curiously curved grating which is one of the distinguishing
features of Tunisian houses. From one of them, however, I was able
to obtain a good view of the Great Mosque of Susa.</p>

<p>This building is of immense dimensions, and bears distinct
traces of its Roman origin. Occupying a site in the heart of the
town, its high walls, enclosing it in the form of an octagon, are
the most marked architectural feature of the place. No Christian
has, of course, ever been allowed to enter it; but by craning my
neck from my bedroom window I was able to see probably as much of
its interior as was ever beheld by infidel eyes. There was a great
courtyard surrounded by a colonnade, the roof of which was
supported by many graceful columns. In the centre of this courtyard
there was a fountain, round which trees were growing. The mosque
itself has not a domed roof such as is common among the mosques of
Turkey; but a flat roof, from which rises a rectangular tower. The
vast dimensions of the building, its curious architecture, and the
mystery which attends its<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_181">[181]</span> origin, make it a structure of great
interest to the traveller, and I was unfeignedly sorry that I could
not gather further information respecting it.</p>

<p>Afrigan made his appearance even whilst I was studying the
mosque. His face bore a strange resemblance to a plum-pudding. “Oh,
sir, the mosquitoes were awful all night,” said he, in lugubrious
tones. “Better come on to Kairwan with me, then?” I responded
blithely. “Well, you see, sir, my wife—” “Oh, but <em>your</em>
wife is a long way off now; so what does it matter what she
thinks?” said I, adroitly turning the tables upon him. Afrigan
smiled as well as he was able with his swollen face, and he shook
his head mournfully. Almost at the same moment there was a knock at
the door, and my second domestic, the Maltese gentleman, entered.
He was laden with some huge lumps of cheese, with half a dozen
loaves, and with a ponderous lantern. Having added these to the
store of provisions already accumulated, he proceeded to inform me,
with great coolness, that we should not be starting for Kairwan
that day. “What do you mean?” I asked, in amazement.<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span> “Well, honourable gentleman,
the French Colonel says the convoy won’t go to-day, and he cannot
tell when one will start.” This was pleasant news. I rushed forth
breakfastless in search of Mr. Gallia. He confirmed the
intelligence. Whether the Colonel had no wish to be burdened by the
presence of an Englishman of an inquiring turn of mind, whether
some good-natured friend had quietly put a spoke in my wheel, or
whether the case was really as stated, I cannot pretend to say.
What is certain is that I was solemnly told that I could not leave
Susa that day, and that nothing could be said as to when I could
leave. A convoy, it was true, was starting that morning. The
Colonel could hardly deny this, inasmuch as I could see for myself
some hundreds of laden camels, defiling through the narrow streets
for the rendezvous at the Kairwan Gate; but it was only going as
far as Wad Loya, the first station on the road, and I could not be
allowed to go with it.</p>

<p>Thus once more my hopes of seeing Kairwan vanished, and on this
occasion finally. My leave of absence was drawing to an
end,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span> and I could
not hang on for an indefinite period at Susa. If I were not
permitted to start at once, I must give up all hope of going at
all. To this painful conclusion I was presently brought. So, after
all, the tinned meats, the pickles, the cheese, the bread, the
candles, had all to be returned to their vendor. Never in my life
had I a harder task than that of inducing this gentleman to take
back his corned beef and sardines. After a struggle, which lasted
nearly an hour, he finally, as a great favour, consented to do so
at a reduction of fifty per cent. upon the price I had paid him for
the same things the day before. It was almost as difficult to get
rid of my Maltese friend of the villainous countenance. I paid him
handsomely for the very small services he had rendered me; and he
went away cursing me audibly. “I think, sir,” said Afrigan, “that
is an impudent man, and you might do a worse thing than to kick
him.” I agreed with Afrigan from the bottom of my heart. As for
Afrigan himself, he was in the seventh heaven of delight when he
found that the expedition to Kairwan was abandoned. “Oh, sir, that
is better. I could not bear<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_184">[184]</span> to think of a gentleman like you sleeping
among the soldiers on the open ground for a whole week in weather
like this. I lay awake all last night—I could not sleep for
thinking about you.” “Come, come, Afrigan: no humbug, if you
please! You know it was the mosquitoes that kept you awake.” “Well,
sir, the mosquitoes were very bad; that is quite true; but it was
worse when I thought of you lying out in all that rain. But now
we’ll go home and say nothing at all to our wives about Kairwan. I
shan’t say anything to mine about Susa either.” And then Afrigan
lighted a cigarette, and strolled off in search of a coffee-house,
humming a gay Arab tune.</p>

<p>I went to breakfast with Mr. Gallia at his house. Nowhere in the
world, I imagine, is a man’s house so entirely his castle as it is
in these semi-savage Arab towns on the north coast of Africa. For
the European resident in a place like Susa there is absolutely no
attraction outside the walls of his own home. He has no society;
such a thing as a dinner-party, or a party of any kind, is
absolutely unknown. He cannot frequent the miserable Arab cafés or
the still more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>
miserable Maltese dram-shops: he cannot enjoy that unfailing
resource of the Englishman who finds himself stranded in a dull
place, a walk out into the country. My friend Mr. Gallia goes down
once or twice a day to the office of the old Turkish harbour-master
of Susa, and sits there for half an hour, smoking, drinking
steaming hot coffee, and looking out upon the beautiful bay, whilst
he listens to the gossip of the port. But these visits to the shore
form the only variety in his monotonous life. All the other hours
of the day must be spent within the walls of his own home, and the
only society he meets with is that of his own family. It will be
seen, then, of what importance the house is in a town like Susa.
The exteriors of the houses here, like those in the Arab quarter of
Tunis, are miserable in the extreme. The residences of even the
wealthiest merchants bear a strong outward resemblance to stables
or barns. But it does not do in this part of the world to judge by
outward appearances; and just as the fairest features that ever
adorned one of the <em>houris</em> of Paradise may be concealed
under the hideous yashmak, so the most luxurious of<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span> abodes may be found within
these rough whitewashed walls.</p>

<p>One peculiarity all the houses have in common, and that is that
they are capable of being easily defended from attack. The house is
generally built in the form of a hollow square. The ground story is
occupied with cellars and offices; and one narrow flight of stairs
gives access to the living apartments. All the windows being
heavily barricaded, it is only necessary to defend the staircase in
order to make the house secure; and as the precaution adopted in
mediæval castles is used here, and the wells are carried up through
thick stone walls to the first floor of the houses, there is every
convenience for withstanding a siege. Mr. Gallia’s house presents
all these characteristics of the local architecture. It has,
besides, an historic interest. A hundred years ago Susa shared with
Tunis and Algiers the distinction of being a favourite haunt of
those seawolves the Turkish and Arab pirates of the Mediterranean,
and at that time the house now occupied by the Vice-Consul of
England was the home of the most notorious of the pirate chiefs. As
I walked through the lofty,<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_187">[187]</span> comfortable rooms, I could not help
wondering whether any hapless fellow-countryman of mine had found
himself here in servitude to his barbarous captor; and even as I
thought of English captives in Susa, I found myself face to face
with one. She was a willing captive, it is true; for she was the
mother of Mr. Gallia. A fine-looking Englishwoman, with pleasant
features and a kindly smile, she was, I need hardly say, a most
welcome apparition in such a place. More than forty years before
she had left her native town of Dover, in order to come to Africa,
and she had never since seen England. There were no railways in her
part of the country when she quitted it; for more than two-score
years Time had been doing its work, and a thousand great changes
had been wrought in the condition of English society. But she knew
nothing of them. As the wife of an Italian gentleman, as the mother
of a numerous family, she had lived her placid, uneventful life in
this dull city, hardly venturing to quit the shelter of her own
home, whilst the busy world outside was going on its own way. Mrs.
Gallia had still a good command of the English
language,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span> and
seemed not a little pleased to meet with one of her
fellow-countrymen, the first whom she had seen for many months.
After breakfast I inspected some of the chief objects of interest
in the house. Among these were some of the magnificent carpets of
Kairwan, the work of the chief ladies of that holy city. Still more
interesting, however, was the large collection of arms which Mr.
Gallia has formed. This collection is, I believe, unique in north
Africa, and is well worth a detailed description. All manner of
Moorish, Arab, and Negro weapons are represented here, as well as
shields and headpieces. But perhaps the most interesting of all the
specimens in the collection are a sword found at Gabes, which there
is every reason to believe was a relic of the Crusades, and a
remarkable Arab rifle with <em>revolving</em> barrels! Truly, there
is nothing new under the sun. Here in Susa, in the old house of a
Turkish pirate, I found a rusty time-worn weapon, certainly more
than a hundred years old, in which the idea of that modern
invention the revolver, was not only distinctly foreshadowed, but
carried out in almost all its details.</p>

<p>And now the time came for me to say<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_189">[189]</span> good-bye to Susa. I first made an
expedition to the bazaar in order to purchase, if possible, a
Kairwan carpet; but none were to be had. The war had for the moment
put an end to the manufacture, or at least to the sale, of these
carpets. Then I went down through the narrow, muddy streets, to the
beach. The sky was gloriously blue; a strong wind was blowing,
which tempered the heat of the sun; but still the warmth was quite
as great as that of an English July, and one found it difficult to
realize the fact that this was a November day. I had decided to
return to Tunis with Afrigan by the <em>Ville de Naples</em>. It
was disappointing, and even humiliating, to go back without having
seen Kairwan; but there was no help for it. Susa, I must say, I was
unreservedly glad to leave. Beautiful as is the situation in which
it stands, and fair as is its outward appearance, it is, upon the
whole, the most unpleasant place of temporary residence in which I
ever found myself stranded.</p>

<p>The water in the bay was very rough, and when I stepped on board
the little boat that was to take me to the ship<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span> which lay at the distance of
half a mile from the shore, I told the men to get me on board as
quickly as possible. They asked if they might wait for two
gentlemen who were going to another vessel, and, somewhat
reluctantly, I consented. What was my surprise and pleasure to find
that these gentlemen were the purser and the surgeon of the
<em>Charles Quint</em>, the “Corsican brothers” of my journey from
Marseilles to Tunis. They came smartly along the wharf, arm-in-arm
as usual, and with that look of sobriety, not to say solemnity, on
their young faces which contrasted so curiously with their years. I
think their pleasure at our meeting equalled my own. We shook hands
warmly, and exchanged notes about Susa, of which we had formed
precisely similar opinions. A very nervous twenty minutes was that
which followed, as our little boat shipped sea after sea, and
danced about in the most eccentric fashion on the top of the waves.
At last, however, we reached the <em>Ville de Naples</em>, the side
of which rose like a vast wall from the sea. I made a desperate
jump and landed on the ladder, waved my adieux to my friends of the
<em>Charles Quint</em>, and climbing to<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_191">[191]</span> the deck, congratulated myself upon the
fact that this splendid ship was far too huge in its dimensions to
be disturbed by any sea she would be likely to encounter in the
Mediterranean.</p>

<p>Alas! for my inexperience. I was now about to encounter the
worst storm I had ever met with in any part of the world. The sole
passengers on board besides myself were Afrigan and a young German,
who was the agent of a Marseilles wine and sardine firm. The latter
shared the saloon with me. About noon we sailed; the wind freshened
immediately afterwards, and we soon found ourselves in the midst of
a gale, whilst the motion of the vessel was so great that it became
almost impossible to keep one’s feet. I had looked forward eagerly
to the dinner-hour, remembering the privations of Susa. When it
came I was surprised to find myself the only person at the table.
Neither my fellow-passenger nor the ship’s officers appeared upon
the scene; and the crash of the crockery on the table almost
drowned the roar of the tempest outside. But we are creatures of
habit. I sat in my comfortable arm-chair and enjoyed the good
things spread<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>
before me without thinking of the storm, or of the somewhat white
faces of the stewards who waited upon me. The sense of having
escaped from the miseries of the hotel of Susa seemed to drown all
thought upon other subjects.</p>

<p>It was whilst I was thus enjoying myself that the captain
appeared, with a somewhat perturbed face, to inform me that he did
not like the look of things; that the gale was increasing, and that
the <em>Ville de Naples</em> being without cargo was not easily
manageable. He had determined, therefore, to run into Kalybia Bay
for shelter, provided he could obtain the assent of the passengers
to his doing so. Now, I wished particularly to get back to Tunis as
speedily as possible, in order that I might catch a boat that I
knew was to start on the following day for Malta. Moreover I did
not believe in the danger of which the captain spoke. No English
captain, I thought, would have spoken of running for shelter under
the circumstances. However, as any man who has travelled much must
be aware, there is one golden rule from which the wise traveller
never departs. That is, to leave the captains of ships and the
drivers of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>
carriages to manage their own business. So with unfeigned
reluctance I expressed my assent to his proposal, and an hour later
we found ourselves at anchor in smooth water under the lee of
Kalybia Point. There were no fewer than five other vessels riding
at anchor here, sheltering from the gale. One of these was a
man-of-war. How strange it was, as I retired to rest, to look from
my port at the lights of these vessels, which were so near to us,
and yet of which I knew so little! We had all found shelter for a
night in this little bay; all having run from a common danger.
To-morrow we should be speeding each on his own path, and every
trace of our meeting would have vanished.</p>

<p>Amid a very heavy gale from the south-east we started again for
Tunis, about six o’clock in the morning. No sooner had we left the
shelter of the bay than we found ourselves in the midst of a
tremendous sea. Huge green waves, topped with foam, were sweeping
down upon us with a force and might that was almost majestic; and
the great ship rolled and tossed upon the troubled waters as if she
had been no bigger or heavier than a cork. We came round Cape Bon
at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span> the very height
of the storm, and a grander sight than that which was then
presented to me I never beheld. I had been lashed upon the
hurricane deck for safety, and as I sat there, at times almost
losing my breath when the ship dipped suddenly, and at other times
looking up in wonder upon the huge mass of the hull which seemed to
be reared above my head as it mounted the waves, I felt like one
who was looking on at the most glorious and exciting of contests.
How our noble ship fought with those angry seas; and how resolute
they seemed to be in their determination to overcome her! One wave
after another came on in endless succession. There seemed no chance
for the vessel; yet she met each successive foe with dauntless
breast. The shriek of the wind through the rigging drowned all
other sounds. The din was indeed appalling. The great rocky
buttresses of Cape Bon, which I had seen a year ago bathed in
summer sunshine, stood out as bulwarks against the raging sea,
which broke upon every point in columns of spray that rose hundreds
of feet in height. The motion of the ship, the splendour of the
scene around me, the glorious freshness of<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_195">[195]</span> the battling winds which buffeted my cheeks
and almost tore my coat from my back, filled me with a strange
sense of exultation. I could have shouted aloud with delight, as we
rode royally over the billows, and resisted the tremendous pressure
of the tempest, which strove furiously to drive us to our doom upon
Cape Bon. Thoughts coursed through my mind even more quickly than
the spray flew through the air around me, and my brain was
quickened, my blood warmed, in a way of which I had known nothing
for months. But all the time one knew how near we were to death. A
break-down of any kind in the engine-room, nay, a momentary error
on the bridge, would have been fatal to every soul on board.</p>

<p>Whilst I thus revelled in the “violent delights” of the storm,
heedless of the “violent ends” to which they might be the
precursors, poor Afrigan and my other fellow-traveller were in
truly doleful state. There must be something demoralizing about
sea-sickness, or rather about the freedom from it. How otherwise
can one account for the fact that even the most amiable of men, if
he were to find himself exempt from that malady whilst<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span> everybody else around him
suffered from it, would feel puffed up with a sense of his own
superiority, as though, forsooth, it was a matter of personal
credit to himself that his stomach happened to be rather more like
that of an ostrich than the stomachs of his fellow-passengers?
Breakfast was not served until we had left Cape Bon far behind us
and were running into the Gulf of Tunis. My forlorn
fellow-passenger, the captain, first and second lieutenants,
purser, and doctor came to the table when the meal began; but long
before it was finished I and the first lieutenant found ourselves
in sole possession of the board. The extraordinary motion of the
ship had driven everybody else, including even the captain, away.
My companion and I were busily discussing the beauties of Glasgow,
when at last the ship was brought to anchor off Goletta. He was the
only man I ever met with who declared that Glasgow was infinitely
to be preferred as a place of residence to London! And he was no
Glaswegian, but a sunburnt native of Marseilles.</p>

<p class="sch">LAST DAYS AT TUNIS.</p>

<p class="csum">A retrospect — The captain of the
<em>Aristides</em> — A curious meeting — Tunis again — Farewell
visits — Rich shopkeepers — A last tussle with Mohamed — A real
Arab gentleman — The Jewellers’ Bazaar — A visit to the Jewish
quarter — An Arabian Night’s Entertainment — Dining, drinking,
dancing.</p>

<p><em>Thursday, November 3rd.</em>—My last day on the shores of
Africa has arrived; but before I say “good-bye” to my faithful
Afrigan, to B——— and P———, and Mr. Reade, and to the wonderful
streets of Tunis, I must indulge in a retrospect, and put together
some notes from those pages of my journal which I have been
compelled to skip in the course of this narrative. First of all,
let me tell how, when the <em>Ville de Naples</em> cast anchor in
the gulf yesterday, I was reassured by seeing the Italian steamer
for Malta still lying at her moorings. The weather was far too
rough to permit of her sailing; the consequence of this is that I
shall, after all, be able to reach Malta before the close of this
week. Even in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>
gulf, and within half a mile of the little breakwater of Goletta,
the sea was so high that the <em>Falcon</em> gunboat was rolling in
a fashion the mere sight of which might have made any squeamish
spectator on shore feel sick. Six sturdy Arabs rowed me ashore from
the <em>Ville de Naples</em>—a long and somewhat dangerous
operation, for which, despite the remonstrances of the economical
Afrigan, I felt compelled to pay double the usual fee.</p>

<p>The rain of the past night had converted the main street of
Goletta into a swamp; but how gay and delightful the whole place
looked after the wretchedness of Susa! Strange indeed is the extent
to which our sense of comfort is relative merely. When I sat down
under the trees in front of the wretched Italian café of Goletta, I
felt almost as much pleased as though I had found myself in the
Grand Café at Paris. There were French officers all round me,
smoking, gossiping, drinking coffee, and reading the latest number
of <em>Figaro</em>, which was being hawked about by a bright little
Jew. Presently up came my old friend the captain of the
<em>Aristides</em>, the English steamer which was wrecked off
Bizerta two days before I first landed in<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_199">[199]</span> Tunis. He has been kept here ever since,
but with British impassiveness seems quite at home at Goletta, and
well able to rub along comfortably, in spite of the fact that he
speaks no word of any language save his own. We hob-nobbed together
over our coffee, and the captain being, like all men in his line of
life, a little of a doctor, began to prescribe for Afrigan. He,
poor fellow, was in dismal plight. The gale had completed the work
which the mosquitoes had begun, and I do not think that anybody
could have recognized in this forlorn wreck the gay and lively
Afrigan of a week before. But not a word of murmuring escaped his
lips. His prevailing feeling seemed to be one of profound
thankfulness at having survived the storm and reached land in
safety. I expressed my regret for having induced him to go with me
to Susa, seeing he had suffered so much from the journey. “Well,
sir, you see, it is a good thing I did go. I always have said that
I am the best sailor in Tunis, and that nothing would make me ill;
but I know now that I did tell a lie when I said so.” And Afrigan
shook his melancholy head, and declining to partake of any
refreshment on the plea that<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_200">[200]</span> all Goletta seemed to his dizzy brain to be
dancing around, relapsed into silence and a cigarette.</p>

<p>For the first and only time during our acquaintance I was
compelled to look after my baggage myself. A sturdy Arab porter was
called, and hoisting my portmanteau and a long white waterproof
coat upon his shoulders, he set off for the station. Presently, in
a moment of carelessness, he let the portmanteau fall into the mud,
thus making necessary the slight application of my stick to his
back. As we were settling this little difficulty, I heard the voice
of an unmistakable Englishman shouting “Bravo! bravo!” and looked
round. The face of the speaker was strange to me, but I saw at once
that he was a fellow-countryman. “An Englishman, I see,” I remarked
casually. “Yes, sir; and you are Mr. Reid, I suppose. I knew it
must be you as soon as I saw that English waterproof, for Mr. B———
told me of your being in the Regency. May I ask, sir, if that
waterproof coat came from Leeds?” “Certainly,” I answered, feeling
rather surprised at the question; “it came from Leeds, and so did
I. But what do you know about Leeds?” “Why,<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_201">[201]</span> I was born there, sir.” And then my
newly found friend explained all about himself, and I discovered
that his paternal home was <em>within two hundred yards of my own
house</em> in a suburb of Leeds. The world is small, indeed; is it
not? I have had so many experiences of the fact that I have almost
ceased to be surprised at incidents of this kind; but I confess it
seemed more than ordinarily strange thus to meet on the shores of
North Africa a man to whom the sound of the Headingley Church bells
was as familiar as it is to myself. It turned out that he was the
locomotive superintendent on the line between Goletta and Tunis,
and that he lived in Goletta with his wife and her mother.</p>

<p>Once more I found myself walking along the Marina of Tunis, and
entering the Grand Hotel. Little as I liked the place, it almost
seemed as though I were getting home again when I entered the
familiar doorway and made my bow to Madame. Then I posted off to
see B———, who started up in surprise when he saw me, believing that
I must have got inside Kairwan by this time. A farewell visit to
Mr. and Mrs. Reade, who have now come up to their house in Tunis
for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span> winter, was
the next duty I had to discharge. I found a pleasant,
youthful-looking man taking afternoon tea with them in the closed
verandah of the Consulate, through the Venetian blinds of which you
may catch a glimpse of the busy scene in the square below. This
gentleman proved to be Captain Selby of the <em>Falcon</em>, and we
chatted for some time together, chiefly about the prospects of
sport for the captain during the coming winter. He hopes to get
some partridge-shooting in Albania, and looks forward to it as a
delightful relief to the monotony of sea-life. Then Mr. Reade gave
us an account of how <em>he</em> visited Kairwan some thirty years
ago, and of the tremendous excitement of the populace when he went
to the baths, from which the natives were rigorously excluded on
the occasion of his visit. And then I said “good-bye.” May the
genial Consul-General and his gracious wife long continue to
prosper! So long as England is represented at Tunis by Mr. Reade,
the best traditions not only of English hospitality but of English
diplomacy are certain to be maintained. One other task still
remained to be performed before I could join B——— at a farewell
dinner. So<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span> once
more I toiled up the narrow, winding street which leads to the
Bazaar, passing all the well-known shops, where the same well-known
figures, clad in their brilliant garments, were seated cross-legged
on the little divans, amid the piles of candles, herbs, slippers,
silk stuffs, and Manchester goods. Many of these shops it is
notorious are not what they seem to be. Their owners have no wish
to sell. A good many of them, indeed, could afford to buy up the
richest of the visitors from abroad who occasionally come to pester
them with their custom. They have simply opened these shops in the
Bazaar in order to divert the attention of the Bey’s officials from
their accumulated wealth. If they were to give up the pretence of
business everybody would know that they had made money, and
presently, under one pretext or another, a means of making them
disgorge part of their wealth would be found. But as it is, so long
as they sit here, in one of the quaint little caverns which are
called shops in the Bazaar, they manage to go free from all except
the collective extortion to which the whole community is at times
compelled to submit. Moreover, the Bazaar<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_204">[204]</span> furnishes the only source of amusement open
to the Tunisian. It is here that he learns all the gossip of the
day, and perhaps takes his share in inventing it. He knows nothing
of the kind of hospitality which is familiar to us in England. The
house of his dearest friend is closed against him, unless it be
upon the occasion of a wedding or a funeral; but the Bazaar is his
club, his exchange, his coffee-house, his news-rooms, and the chief
pleasure of life would be gone if he were no longer permitted to
frequent it. I picked my way over the broken pavement of the narrow
darkened alleys of the Bazaar until I came to Mohamed’s. He was not
in his shop; but his assistant at once ran to fetch him, whilst the
inevitable cup of fragrant coffee was served for my benefit.
Mohamed seemed much pleased at my return, but his face fell when I
told him that I was about to leave for good. This fact, however,
did not interfere with a very smart tussle between us over the
price of a silk <em>jebba</em>—the principal garment worn by the
town Arabs—which I was anxious to possess. I had sent Afrigan home
because of his melancholy plight, so I was compelled to rely
exclusively upon myself<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_205">[205]</span> in conducting this bargain. I had, however,
a very simple and efficient method of handling Mohamed. I allowed
him to ask all manner of enormous sums for the <em>jebba</em>,
simply contenting myself with repeating in a monotonous voice
“Thirty francs”—that being just ten francs less than the sum I
meant to pay.</p>

<p>Never was Mohamed more eloquent than upon this occasion. He had
summoned an old Turk who spoke a few words of French to his aid,
and this worthy expatiated as well as he could upon the beauties of
the particular <em>jebba</em> upon which I had fixed my attention;
its colour, its texture, its workmanship were all perfect, and it
was worth at the very least 100 francs. When I thought that a
sufficient amount of time had been spent in this way I rose, and
shaking my head blandly, held out my hand to Mohamed saying as I
did so, “Forty francs, and not a caroub more.” The good merchant
seized my hand with the utmost cordiality, and the bargain was
struck in an instant. Then he made a desperate attempt to induce me
to buy some carpets, some of the curious inlaid Moorish tables, and
similar<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span> articles,
of which he possessed a large quantity. Finding, however, that I
had now completed my transactions with him, and that no more money
was to be made out of me, his whole demeanour changed. But it
changed not in the way familiar to me in Constantinople, in Vienna,
in Paris, aye and even in civilized London, where the cringing
subserviency of the vendor too often turns to rank insolence when
he discovers that he has extracted the last sou from the pocket of
his customer. This Arab shopkeeper of the Bazaar of Tunis, despite
those characteristic failings of which I have spoken, is a
noble-minded gentleman; and as soon as he discovered that I had
ceased to be his customer, he began to treat me as a guest.</p>

<p>More coffee was brought, cigarettes were lighted, and by the aid
of the disreputable old Turk we struck up a friendly conversation,
in which a great deal was said about Tunis, about England, and
about the French. Mohamed is an Anglomaniac. He believes that the
banner of St. George will yet bring freedom to the Arabs of
Northern Africa, and he prays morning and evening for the hour when
the deliverance of his country shall be effected<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span> by means of English courage.
“Tell them when you cross the seas, illustrious Englishman, that
the Arabs are waiting for your countrymen, and will welcome them
with all their hearts; tell them that all that we have is theirs,
and that we love them and long for them, because we know we can
trust them to do us justice!” One could not look at that handsome,
grave, beautiful face, which the picturesque turban set off to such
advantage, without feeling that this merchant of the Bazaar was a
true aristocrat, and that the race which could boast of such men
could not be regarded as altogether effete. Then Mohamed when the
time came for me to leave him, begged that I would stay yet a
little longer; and presently he produced from some dark recess a
small Tunisian purse in scarlet leather, richly embroidered with
silver, and asked me to accept the trifle in remembrance of the man
whom I had honoured with my patronage. So finally we shook hands
once again, and “I went on my way and saw him no more.”</p>

<p>I still had one additional experience to encounter in the
Bazaar, however, before I finally quitted it. I was anxious to
obtain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span> some of the
silver coffee-cup holders which are used by the wealthy Tunisians,
and for this purpose I had to visit the jewellers’ quarter. My
readers will accuse me of exaggeration if I attempt to give them an
exact description of this part of the Bazaar. I regretted whilst I
was there that I had not provided myself with a measuring-tape, in
order to ascertain the precise dimensions of the streets through
which I passed, and of the shops and houses I saw. I seemed to have
entered a sort of Lilliput Land; where, however, the inhabitants
were of normal size, though all their surroundings were
extraordinarily narrow and minute. The little unpaved alleys were
in no instance more than three feet wide, and at certain places
they were little more than half that width, so that two persons
found it difficult to pass each other. The houses were of the size
of ordinary English pig-sties, and I am afraid I must say that size
was not the only matter in which the resemblance was to be found.
Under the guidance of an astute Jew, I threaded my way through a
labyrinth of these wonderful passages. On all sides of me were the
shops where the workers in<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_209">[209]</span> silver and gold were hammering the precious
metals on tiny anvils, or melting them in little charcoal stoves.
At last my conductor, stooping low, entered one of these shops, in
which two workmen were busy. Passing them with a nod and a murmured
word, he led me into a somewhat larger apartment at the back of the
shop. I should think it was about seven feet square. Here, in a
glass case, were the objects which I wanted. I bid him a price, but
found that my rude method of bargaining was not effectual here.
There is a fixed price for the precious metals; and even these
delicate silver cups are sold by weight. I bought two of them for a
sum which, if not literally “an old song,” was yet hardly more in
the figurative sense.</p>

<p>This visit to the Jewellers’ Bazaar, where the business is
chiefly carried on by Jews, reminds me of one of the most
interesting incidents of my stay in Tunis—the visit I paid in the
company of Mr. Levy to the Jews’ quarter of the city. It was one
Saturday afternoon when Mr. Levy invited me to accompany him on a
walk through the wonderful maze of narrow streets in which
the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span> Jews live.
Saturday had, of course, been selected because it is the day on
which the Jews are in the habit of showing themselves most freely,
and also the day upon which the women put on their most gorgeous
dresses. During the other days of the week the short silk chemise
or jacket and cotton tights form the principal articles of their
attire. On the Sabbath, however, instead of the cotton tights being
worn, their shapely limbs are encased in glittering breeches,
richly adorned with gold and silver embroidery; the silk jackets
are of the gayest colours, and a quaint conical cap is worn on the
back of the head—something after the style of the head-dress of
Englishwomen in the days of the Plantagenets. The young men, too,
wear on Saturday their newest and smartest burnouses, white, blue,
and a pale olive green being their favourite colours. It is easy to
conceive that a crowd of men and women thus attired wear a strange
appearance in the eyes of the Europeans. Not a black coat or an
ordinary bonnet is to be seen in such a crowd, but everywhere the
most brilliant hues and the most graceful forms of drapery are
mingled in a confused<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_211">[211]</span> mass, the component parts of which it is
almost impossible for the eye to distinguish. It was a wonderful
network of narrow streets through which Mr. Levy led me. Few were
more than five feet wide, many of them being still narrower; and
everywhere the architecture showed that the Jew’s house in Tunis is
of necessity his fortress also. Every window was heavily barred,
the grating generally being of the curious curved shape which is
one of the distinguishing features of street scenery in the
Regency. The doors of stout oak were studded with heavy iron bolts,
and secured by ponderous locks and bars. As in other parts of
Tunis, the streets often run under a kind of tunnel, the houses
being built over them for a considerable distance. In these places
it was necessary to tread very carefully, for the thoroughfare was
wrapped in darkness, and the pavement was always atrociously
bad.</p>

<p>On this particular Sabbath all the doors of the houses seemed to
be thrown open, and through them one caught glimpses of cool airy
courtyards, where the children were playing, and the women in their
quaint and—according to European notions—indecent<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span> attire, were gossiping
together; the men of each particular family being squatted apart,
solemnly smoking, or wagging their beards in grave conversation.
Hundreds of young men and women—the faces of both sexes being
strikingly beautiful—were promenading up and down the narrow
winding lanes, but there was no love-making visible, and no
intermingling of the sexes such as we are accustomed to in Europe.
It is not the fashion here for a pair of lovers, even of the
humblest class, to “walk out” together. Yet, even in Tunis, and in
this dark and crowded ghetto, love asserts its rights, and women
are true to their inborn nature. From a hundred grated windows
bright black eyes flashed down upon me as I walked through the
gloomy labyrinth of filthy lanes, and many faces dusky of hue yet
beautiful of feature were to be seen; and once, as I passed one of
the jealously barred windows, I noticed that the lattice was open,
and I heard a musical “<em>Bon soir! monsieur!</em>” fall upon my
ears like a benediction.</p>

<p>It was under Mr. Levy’s guidance that on one evening during my
stay in Tunis I had the pleasure of enjoying an
experience<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span> that I
may well call unique—a real Arabian Night’s Entertainment. I had
met at the house of Mr. Reade a Tunisian gentleman of high family
and enormous wealth, General Ben Ayad by name. This gentleman is
justly regarded as being the finest specimen of the Moorish
aristocracy now living in Tunis. Strange to say, he is an English
subject by birth; his grandfather having some fifty years ago got
himself enrolled as a subject of the King of England in order the
better to secure his property from the rapacity of the French, who,
even at that time, had begun to cast covetous eyes upon Tunis. The
possessor not only of splendid estates in the country, but of many
fine palaces in and about Tunis, General Ben Ayad takes pleasure in
showing hospitality to all English visitors to the Regency. He made
many apologies to me for being unable to offer me any sport,
explaining that the disturbed state of the country prevented his
visiting his sporting estates. Learning, however, that I had not
seen one of the characteristic native dances, he kindly sent me an
invitation to an entertainment at his house, which was got up
entirely in my honour. Mr.<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_214">[214]</span> Levy acted as my conductor, and I was
accompanied by two of my English friends resident in the Regency.
The hour fixed for our arrival was half-past seven in the evening,
and shortly before that time we started from the hotel. A walk of
twenty minutes through the most wonderful network of narrow lanes
with blank, whitewashed walls on either side, here and there
diversified by a door opening into a dismal-looking vaulted
apartment, or a long, low archway spanning the path, brought us at
last to a little courtyard surrounded by buildings apparently of
the utmost squalor. All was dark and silent, and not a creature was
to be met with. Levy pushed open a door, and cautiously sounding
the pavement with his iron-shod staff, led the way up a large
staircase with oaken balustrade, marble steps, and tiled walls.
Still no one appeared. A solitary oil-lamp cast a flickering light
over the staircase, but we seemed to have entered a deserted
house.</p>

<p>Suddenly a door was thrown open, and, as if by magic, the scene
changed. We saw before us a vast and brilliantly lighted apartment,
the extreme length of which could<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_215">[215]</span> not have been less than sixty feet, nor its
breadth less than forty. Brilliantly illuminated both by gas jets
and countless candles, its richly tiled walls and gaily painted
ceiling fairly glittered with light. It was furnished with huge
looking-glasses, set in swinging frames like those used by ladies
in their dressing-rooms, and wardrobes and cabinets of large size.
The woodwork of all these was of the most brilliant vermilion red,
lavishly picked out with gold, and the general effect of this
barbaric splendour was so grand that I was filled with surprise as
I found myself in this noble hall, and felt fairly dazzled by the
magnificence of the scene. Couches and settees in glowing colours,
besides many chairs, small tables, &amp;c., were scattered about
the floor of the apartment, and on the walls were hung many fine
old engravings, including, strange to say, a portrait of the late
Pope—a rather curious object to find in the house of a Mahometan.
Ben Ayad, his eldest son, and several relatives and domestics, were
awaiting us in this apartment, and the tall and stately Arab
general gave me the warmest of welcomes. He apologized at the same
time for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span> not being
able to entertain me properly. His household, it seemed, was still
at his country mansion at Sidi bou Said, and in consequence he
could only invite me to sup with him <em>en garçon</em>. With this
explanation he pointed smilingly to a great round table, on which
was laid out a repast that promised well for the satisfaction of
our creature comforts. Then he led me into a second drawing-room,
an apartment still more beautiful than the first.</p>

<p>This room was forty feet square. On all sides of it were doors
and windows with rich hangings; splendid couches and chairs in
crimson and gold were placed round it, except on one side, where
there was an enormous settee, at least twenty-five feet in length.
On marble console tables stood valuable vases of Sèvres, and two
beautiful ormolu clocks, the gift of Louis Philippe to Ben Ayad’s
grandfather. But the finest feature of this room was the lovely
arabesque ceiling—one of the most perfect specimens of Moorish
decoration I ever saw. How it would have gladdened the heart of
Owen Jones! An enormous crystal chandelier was pendant from this
ceiling, but it was not<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_217">[217]</span> used, the room being lighted by gas and oil
lamps. I confess that for a time I was completely bewildered by the
sudden change from the squalor and darkness of the streets outside
to the brilliant interior in which I now found myself.</p>

<p>After I had talked a little time with Ben Ayed, and had partaken
of coffee, served in beautiful silver holders by servants in
graceful Arab dress, the musicians and dancers who were to
entertain us entered. These were Jews and Jewesses—in their
national costume. They squatted down on cushions arranged on the
floor, and after being supplied with refreshments presently began
to play. Their instruments were a violin, a mandolin, a tambourine,
and a tabouka, or native drum, the barrel of which is made of
earthenware, and which is struck with the points of the fingers.
They played a long, plaintive Arab melody, quaint and even weird,
and strikingly unlike anything I have heard before, except in
Turkey and from the gipsies in Roumania. This music, which was a
sort of prelude to the entertainment, having ceased, we went to
dinner. It was a really sumptuous repast, nearly all
the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span> dishes,
however, being Arab. We began with delicious couscousoo; then came,
as a relish, potarga, the dried roe of the red mullet. This
delicacy, which is made at Bizerta, bears some resemblance to
caviare, though without the oiliness of that article. Olives,
radishes, &amp;c., were also eaten with this course. Next another
Arab dish was served, which, however, was not quite so palatable—it
consisted of hot and rather greasy fritters, enclosing meat and
eggs; cold chicken served with a kind of egg paste, very light and
dainty; excellent roast mutton; <em>foie gras en aspic</em>, and a
most wonderful assortment of pastry and sweets completed this part
of the repast. I ought to say that the sweets and pastry were of
Arab not Italian cookery, and were most deliciously flavoured with
pistachio. Melons, pomegranates, and other exquisite fruits were
served after the meal, which was accompanied by capital Bordeaux,
very fine Malaga, and excellent champagne, ice being plentifully
supplied with the wine. We all drank to each other, to the
prosperity of Tunis, &amp;c., and many very polite speeches were
made by the host and the rest of us. Returning<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_219">[219]</span> to the drawing-room at the close of this
meal, we listened to a song given by all the musicians and dancers.
No words can convey any idea of the peculiar melody, or rather, to
my uncultivated ears, want of melody, which characterized this
production. It was melancholy in the extreme,—a long wail,
accompanied by sudden bursts of discord. It was, however, said to
be the favourite love-song of Tunis.</p>

<p>The youngest and best-looking of the dancers having left the
room for a few minutes, reappeared in Greek costume. She clapped
her hands loudly to keep time to the music and began to dance, the
figure bearing some resemblance to the Highland Fling, the motions
being grotesque rather than graceful. Sometimes she hopped round
the room on one leg, sometimes she jumped like a frog; at times she
bounded from the floor, waving gay silken scarfs above her head.
Then the peculiar part of the dance began—and here I must stay my
pen. Though there was nothing coarse in the performance, the woman
herself being decently clad, no one could mistake the indelicacy of
the <em>motif</em>. The long dance at an<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_220">[220]</span> end, coffee, cigars, and liqueurs were
served to us by the retinue of servants. Ben Ayad had sent to
procure some of the best Arab dancers to add to our amusement; but
his retainers had returned unsuccessful. They had procured the
women, it appeared; but when it was found that they were to be
asked to dance before a Christian, their neighbours rose in a mass,
stoned the unfortunate domestics, and rescued the women! It was not
until long after midnight that I left the hospitable roof of my
Arab friend, five of his servants escorting me through the streets
with lanterns and arms to the door of my hotel.</p>

<p class="sch">GOOD-BYE TO GOLETTA.</p>

<p class="csum">An Arab holiday — A state reception — A last look
at the Bab el Bahr — The heir apparent — An English sailor’s
courage — Italian greed — The <em>Sicilia</em> — Sea-sick
Arabs.</p>

<p><em>Thursday, November 3rd.</em>—This last morning of my stay in
Tunis broke in cloudless splendour. The weather, which has been so
unsettled for some days, seems suddenly to have improved, and we
appear to be entering upon another summer. The heat is intense; and
as I laboured in the courtyard of the hotel at the troublesome task
of marking the various boxes containing my purchases, the
perspiration literally streamed off my face, and again and again I
had to sit down exhausted. At half-past nine I sent off Afrigan to
Goletta with the whole of my <em>impedimenta</em>, which he is to
see safely on board the <em>Sicilia</em>, the Rubattino boat in
which I go to Malta. Then I went out for a last walk in Tunis.
To-day is one of the great festivals of the<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_222">[222]</span> Arabs—the Feast of the Bairam. Hitherto
the eve of the feast has always been marked by a fair held on a
vacant space of ground within the walls, close to the Kasbah. I
went up to this place yesterday evening in order to see this
festivity, but found to my regret that the fair is not being held
this year—another token of the way in which the natives regard the
French occupation and the “protection” of M. Roustan. This morning,
however, there were evident signs that the day was a holiday. All
the Arabs were dressed in their smartest attire, and those of them
who possess the Order of the Bey wore it proudly. Bands of music,
the strains they poured forth being of the most unmelodious
character, were passing through the streets, and a score of fine
carriages dashed past the hotel on the way to the Bardo, where the
Bey to-day holds a state reception.</p>

<p>I have, by the way, lost a chance of making the acquaintance of
this high and mighty potentate. Mr. Reade kindly asked me to
accompany him to the Palace, in order that he might present me to
his Highness. But I subsequently learned that a dress coat was
<em>de rigueur</em> on such occasions: and alas!<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span> when I packed my portmanteaus
before leaving home I tossed out of them the dress suit which they
originally contained, not thinking that I should require it during
my stay in Africa. The Consul-General thought that the Bey might
stretch a point in my favour, in consideration of my being merely a
passing tourist. But his Highness is at this moment in sore trouble
and humiliation, and it would have been improper under the
circumstances to present oneself in a manner which might be
construed into a want of respect for the fallen potentate. So I
lost the opportunity of making the acquaintance of the ruler of
this curious land. If I could not see the Bey this morning,
however, there was nothing to prevent my seeing his people. This
Feast of the Bairam is the nearest approach to our English
Christmas which the Arabs know. It is a festival of friendship and
goodwill. Accordingly, every Arab who meets an acquaintance in the
streets this morning stops and gives him a kiss of brotherly love.
It was curious indeed to see these solemn, bearded old gentlemen
engaged in this operation. Not a word was spoken either by the
kisser or the kissed: but hands<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_224">[224]</span> were touched, and the lips of the one
pressed to the cheek of the other. I noticed, however, that where
there was a great social distance between the two, as in the case
of my friend General Ben Ayad and one of the ordinary Moors of the
town, it was only the rich man’s hand, and not his cheek, that was
kissed. These good Tunisians are not the only people in the world,
however, who keep up forms and ceremonies long after the life has
gone out of them.</p>

<p>For the last time I took my stand on the steps of the Grand
Hotel, and surveyed that wonderful panorama which is for ever being
displayed in the Marina. Over the way was the coffee-house of the
colonnade where, under the shade of the arches, I have drunk so
many glasses of lemonade and vermouth. It was crowded to-day with
the usual throng of French officers—all of them wearing full
uniform in honour of the Bairam—and special correspondents for the
Paris Press, each fingering the red rosette in his button-hole with
that air of intense satisfaction which only a decorated Frenchman
can assume. To my right, beyond the palm-trees in the little
garden, rose the fine Moorish gateway<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_225">[225]</span> which gives admission to the square of the
Consulate. To-day, as on all days, it appeared the centre of the
life of Tunis. A hundred vendors of cakes, sweetmeats, fruits,
matches, trinkets, were pushing hither and thither, waving their
feather brushes to drive away the clouds of flies, and filling the
air with a clamour which reminded one of Whitechapel on a Saturday
evening. The drivers of mules and camels were raising hoarse cries
of warning as the animals in their charge unceremoniously pushed
their way through the throng: squatting at the feet of the pillars
of the gateway were hideous figures veiled in black yashmaks. They
might be the fairest of virgins, or the ugliest and vilest of
crones; it was all one to the spectator who saw them, sitting in
patience, beside the loaves of bread which it is their business to
sell. Half-a-dozen of the city guards passed under the gate in
Indian file, their rusty muskets carried at all possible angles;
their bared feet and ragged raiment proving to what straits the
national exchequer has been reduced. Then a couple of French
<em>gens-d’armes</em> emerged from the throng, neat, clean and well
dressed, with their hands on the<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_226">[226]</span> butts of their revolvers. The smiling ruddy
face of my friend B———, who seems tall of stature even in this land
peopled by the sons of Anak, showed itself above the white and blue
turbans, as he strode towards me, waving aloft the latest message
from Kairwan, and followed by a knot of children, Jews and Arabs,
all alike bent upon extracting a caroub from his pocket. Turning
from this scene of bustle and excitement, I saw the broad street
immediately in front of the hotel filled by troops of Moors of the
better class, patrolling up and down in their brilliant robes,
deeply engaged in conversation with each other; and presently an
open landau dashed past, and I recognized the somewhat
insignificant features and figure of M. Roustan, the Mephistopheles
of Tunis, who was returning from his formal visit to the Bardo. And
over all this brilliant varied scene there was the intensely blue
and cloudless sky of Africa. It was hard to tear oneself away from
the spot. As I said at the outset of my narrative, the eye at least
may always enjoy a perpetual feast in Tunis. My ideas of the
picturesque were not small before I came here; and I had seen
something of the East<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_227">[227]</span> and of Eastern life before ever I set foot
on African soil. But what I have seen in Tunis has given me
altogether new ideas of the really picturesque. How I have longed
for the faculty of the artist, so that I might convey some faint
idea to those at a distance of the glories and wonders of this
place—the glories and wonders of the sky, of the vegetation, of the
hills, of the cities, of the people. Poor indeed are words, even at
the best, to convey any real idea of natural scenery or of
unfamiliar forms; and I believe that even the author of the
“Princess of Thule” would find himself baffled in the attempt to
bring home to readers in England that infinite variety of colour
and shape, that endless succession of picturesque groups and still
more picturesque interiors by which the eye is greeted on every
side in Tunis. If I could but bring before the mind’s eye of my
reader, I will not say the view from the Grand Hotel of which I
have been speaking, but a correct and vivid idea of the inside of a
single Arab coffee-shop, I should feel that I had not written
altogether in vain.</p>

<p>But the moment of departure had arrived, and B——— reminded me
that even in Africa<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>
trains started with tolerable punctuality. So I said good-bye to
the waiters of the Grand Hotel, and presently found myself in the
train bound for Goletta. There was in the train with me the eldest
nephew of the Bey, and the heir-expectant to his throne. As he
stood on the little gangway outside the carriage in the Tunis
station, most of the Arabs as they passed him stopped to kiss his
hand or the skirt of his frock-coat. He is a rather good-looking
young man, with a face not quite so sensual as those of most of the
Moors of the upper classes are. There was, however, no sign of
strength of will or vigour in his countenance, nor anything to make
one hope that under his sway Tunis would be happier than it has
been under the rule of his uncle. In a third-class carriage
adjoining that in which the young Prince rode, I recognized the
business man of the unlucky Taib Bey. When he saw me he came out
upon the gangway, and as the train was whirled onwards towards
Goletta he shouted to me in French an energetic appeal on behalf of
his master, “An honest man, monsieur! an intelligent man! The only
man who can save Tunis! Tell the English all<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_229">[229]</span> that, I beg of you.” If all Taib’s
servants are as faithful and zealous as this Arab is, he is not
after all so unlucky as he might seem to be.</p>

<p>There was yet another acquaintance of mine in the train. This
was once more the Captain of the <em>Aristides</em>. He had a
wonderful tale to tell of the pluck of the third mate of that
unfortunate vessel. This man, whose name, I am sorry to say, I
cannot give, was sent by sea to Bizerta last week in order to look
after the wreck. Having fulfilled his duty there, he was anxious to
return to Goletta as quickly as possible, but found that no steamer
would call off the port for several days. Thereupon, with the
foolhardy valour of an English tar, he set off by land! Seeing that
the whole country in that direction is swarming with insurgent
Arabs, and that hitherto they have murdered without remorse every
single Christian who has fallen into their hands, the risks of such
a journey can be well understood. Nevertheless the man, who was
accompanied by a native guide, got through in safety. Perhaps this
was due in part to the fact that the poor fellow had no money in
his possession, as, like the rest of the crew of the
<em>Aristides</em>, he is living at present<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_230">[230]</span> on the somewhat meagre allowance
provided for “distressed British seamen” by the Vice-Consul. It
appears that he was stopped six times between Bizerta and Tunis by
parties of armed Arabs. On each occasion the first order given to
him was to turn out his pockets. It may be imagined how much the
pockets contained after the last of these operations! Then when the
robbers had satisfied themselves that there was nothing to be got
from their victim, they invariably put one question to his
guide—“Is he a Frenchman?” The answer was, of course, in the
negative. What the poor creature’s fate would have been if it had
been otherwise, could be plainly guessed by himself, as the Arabs
drew their long broad-bladed swords each time that they made this
inquiry, and were evidently prepared to cut him into pieces without
delay if he proved to be a fellow-countryman of M. Roustan. Even as
it was, and when it had been made known that he was an Englishman,
there were long consultations and sometimes warm disputes before he
was allowed to pass. Not many men living have enjoyed (!) such a
journey as that was; but the hero of the adventure looked perfectly
unconcerned when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span> I
saw him at Goletta, and was evidently quite unconscious of the fact
that he had performed an extraordinary feat. His chief subject of
conversation was, “the greediness of them ’ere h’Arabs, sir. Why
bless you, they didn’t leave me as much as a piece of baccy after
they’d turned me over the first time.”</p>

<p>It was after reaching Goletta that I discovered that there is
even greater greed than that of the Arabs. I had taken my passage
to Malta by the Rubattino boat <em>Sicilia</em> on the previous
day, and for the short trip of twenty-one hours had paid the
respectable sum of forty-five francs. I now learned to my disgust
that even this exorbitant fare does not include food, which must be
paid for extra! With not a little regret I stepped off the shore at
Goletta, and found myself once more on board one of the
broad-beamed port boats. We were a motley company. Steamers were
also starting at the same time as the <em>Sicilia</em> for Bone and
Marseilles, and for Susa and Tripoli. So we had on board with us an
unkempt and not particularly clean Frenchwoman, who was somewhat
disconsolately making her way back to her native land, not having
found Tunis, so far as she herself<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_232">[232]</span> was concerned, quite the field of promise
that she had been led to believe it was; a smart-looking commercial
traveller bound for Marseilles; half a dozen Arabs going down the
Gulf of Hammamet laden with merchandise wrapped in filthy carpets;
a couple of Maltese bound for their island home, and carrying with
them some huge cages filled with canaries; a very venerable-looking
Jew, who was creeping back to Sfax to see what was left of his
property after the sack of the place by the French; and one or two
others. Afrigan seemed to know everybody in the boat, and kept up a
lively conversation with all of them, whilst he maintained at the
same time a running description of the various personages on board
for my benefit.</p>

<p>We first went to the steamer for Susa, and here fully half an
hour was spent in a terrific contest between the boatmen on the one
hand and the Arabs and Jews on the other as to the amount to be
paid for the passage from the shore. Such shrieking, such gestures,
such bursts of guttural passion, were surely never heard or seen
before outside of Bedlam! The boatmen had followed the defaulting
passengers on deck, and were<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_233">[233]</span> pursuing them all over the steamer, making
the air ring with their curses and lamentations. After half an hour
of this performance I became impatient, and having won over the two
Maltese to my side, I cast loose the rope by which we were fastened
to the ladder of the steamer, and proposed that we should row
ourselves to the <em>Sicilia</em>. Then indeed there was an
exhibition on board the Susa boat! When the ruffianly boatmen, who
had treated all our expostulations with contempt, saw that we had
mutinied and were going off without them, they were for a moment
silent with horror: only for a moment, however; for no sooner had
they realized the situation than they raised a yell which would
have done credit to the lungs of a band of Indians on the war-path.
Running like cats along the deck of the steamer, they climbed into
the chains at the bow, and swung themselves dexterously into the
boat as it passed. There were six of them, and they were all big
fellows, so I thought it prudent not to apply my stick to their
shoulders; and satisfied with having compelled them to resume their
journey, I willingly gave up my oar to the ringleader, a coal-black
negro from the Soudan.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span>The
<em>Sicilia</em> is a wretched little boat of some five or six
hundred tons, and my first glance at it showed me how greatly
inferior it was to the noble French steamers, in which I had
hitherto been sailing. Nobody on board spoke a word of either
French or English; and from the captain downwards the officers
seemed a slovenly and not over clean set of fellows. They had,
however, that English look about them which often distinguishes
Italian sailors; and if in their want of politeness they furnished
a great contrast to the officers of the <em>Ville de Naples</em>
and <em>Charles Quint</em>, they were, at least so far as
appearances went, bluff, good-natured men. I said good-bye to
Afrigan—a final good-bye this time—with a somewhat heavy heart; for
I have travelled far enough in the journey of life to have learned
the value of honesty, faithfulness, kindliness, and personal
devotion—and all these qualities I had found in this worthy fellow.
“Won’t you come as far as Malta with me, Afrigan, just for a
change?” The tears had been standing in his eyes for some minutes.
He had not been saying much about our separation, but he had been
deeply engaged in enlightening the officers<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_235">[235]</span> of the <em>Sicilia</em> as to the
importance of the passenger whom they were now privileged to carry,
and had given me a personal character so flattering that I was
thankful that none of my friends at home could hear it. It was his
last and most anxious wish that I should be comfortable and well
cared for, even after his own connexion with me had ceased. Now,
however, when I uttered these words, a rueful smile broke over his
face. “Dear sir,” he said, “you see, I have a wife, and she—” “Yes,
yes, Afrigan; I’ve heard that before. Well, good-bye, and God bless
you!” “Good-bye, sir; and if ever you come to Tunis again you will
find me waiting for you. There is no gentleman I would serve sooner
than yourself.” And then he ran down the ladder, and waving his
hand, and shouting his last words of farewell and thanks, he
presently faded away into the glowing distance on the sunlit
waters.</p>

<p>The afternoon was lovely, and my last look at Tunis and the
beautiful gulf was delightful. There were the white houses of
Goletta, with the Bey’s curious water-palace, built on piles,
standing out boldly from the others. It is here that for years he
has led his somewhat<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_236">[236]</span> lonely life, in the company of his prime
favourite Mustapha, the barber’s boy, who by stages of truly
Oriental advancement rose, before he was thirty years of age, to
the chief position in the Regency. It is here also that he has been
living, sad and sick and solitary, since the claws of the French
eagle were plunged into the heart of Tunis, and his beloved
Mustapha was torn from him and sent into exile. One cannot but feel
sorry for this fallen ruler. Great faults, grave vices, he
undoubtedly has; but he has always meant well by his country, and
has done his best for her, according to his lights. He has been
kindly in his judgments, administering justice so far as he could
with honesty and straightforwardness, and shrinking from the resort
to the death-penalty as much as the Emperor of Germany himself
does. Above all, he has been blameless in his conduct towards the
French, and yet it is the French by whom he has now been attacked
and ruined. All these thoughts passed through my mind as I looked
on that plain white building, flooded with the afternoon sunshine,
against which the golden waves of the gulf were now gently lapping.
It is not always easy to realize the<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_237">[237]</span> personal tragedies which are involved in
the great political movements of the world—the private woes which
must ever accompany the development of a State policy. But nobody
can have been in Tunis during the last three months without being
able to realize all this.</p>

<p>Away to the right of the palace was the barren desolate site of
Carthage; and still further to the right was the Arab town of Sidi
bou Said, where my friend Ben Ayad has his favourite residence. Its
white walls glittered in the sunshine, and its grand situation and
imposing appearance almost led one to believe, in spite of all the
experience I have acquired recently, that it must be a desirable
place of residence. The centre of the picture on which I looked
from the deck of the <em>Sicilia</em> was the harbour of Goletta,
with the broad sheet of the Lake of Tunis behind it, and in the dim
distance the towers and roofs of Tunis itself. To the left were the
high and precipitous ranges of the Lead Mountains, and far away I
could dimly discern the sharp peaks of the blue Zaghouan Hills. How
deeply one felt now regret at not having been able to explore the
beautiful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span> country
which lies everywhere around the city of Tunis. What noble vistas
of smiling valleys, rocky gorges, and billowy uplands were
everywhere visible! Yet all had been a closed book to me during my
stay in the Regency. Some day, however, I may come again to see
Tunis more thoroughly and under happier auspices. Close at hand, in
the bay, there were many stately vessels, including the <em>Ville
de Naples</em>. How gladly I would have exchanged my present
position as sole cabin passenger on board the <em>Sicilia</em> for
a berth on board the noble French steamer, even although I had been
called upon to face another storm like that off Cape Bon!</p>

<p>At three o’clock we weighed anchor, and started with a fresh
breeze in our favour. There was comparatively little sea, but the
vessel pitched horribly, and with the “usual consequences,” so far
as my fellow-passengers in the fore-cabin were concerned. Whilst I
was down below arranging my luggage, I heard a terrific noise on
deck, accompanied by yells of “Allah! Allah!” I thought that at
least a Mussulman mutiny had broken out, and rushed up the
companion way to see what was the matter. It was only a couple
of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span> Arabs settling
accounts with the Mediterranean, and piously invoking Allah in
concert between the throes of sickness! Dinner was served at
half-past four, and as the sole first-class passenger I had for my
companions at table only the ship’s officers. The meal was rather
better than I had expected, though oil and garlic were as usual too
plentiful in all the dishes. Wrapped in a warm camel’s-hair
burnous, I lay on the deck enjoying the fresh breeze and the
brilliant starlight, and smoking innumerable cigarettes, until at
last I dropped off to sleep. Fortunately for my comfort, my
suffering fellow-passengers had all gone below, so that I was free
from the gruesome sights and sounds that had abounded so long as
they had remained on deck. I awoke, shivering, at midnight. The old
boat was still tumbling along like a porpoise over the bright
waters. I went below, but found that the vile little hole allotted
to me as a state-room smelt so horribly that it was absolutely
impossible to sleep in it, so I lay down in the saloon, and was
soon lulled into the profoundest slumber by the thumping of the
screw.</p>

<p class="csum">Malta — The Union Club — A delightful change — The
harbour by moonlight — A thrilling scene — The <em>Elettrico</em> —
Etna — Messina — Between Scylla and Charybdis — Sunrise off Naples
— Home again.</p>

<p><em>Friday, November 4th.</em>—When day broke I found that there
was another lovely morning—a genuine Mediterranean day, in fact. By
six o’clock I was on deck, drinking in the pure air of the sea,
doubly welcome after the stifling heat and stench below deck. Not a
sail was in sight. Breakfast, which was served at nine o’clock, was
rather trying. It consisted of a sort of stew of meat, raw
herrings, fried eggs, and fruit. But the long low outline of Gozo
was now in sight, and my spirits were rising. Passing vessels, too,
became numerous, for we were in the track of the homeward-bound
steamers from Malta; and then, the weather was simply perfect. The
sea was quite calm, the sky without a cloud, the sun hot, the air
balmy, the colour<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span>
of the water blue as a sapphire. Even although one was thinking
much about England, from which I had received no letters for
several weeks, and longing to get home again, it was impossible not
to contrast this delicious weather with that which was prevailing
at the same moment within the limits of the United Kingdom. Nor, as
the white cliffs of Malta came full in view, could one refrain from
thinking of the last visit I paid to this “sunny isle,” less than
twelve months ago, when I had as my companions two good fellows,
neither of whom moves by sea or land any more, and one of whom now
lies yonder in the naval cemetery above the harbour of Valetta. A
year ago, how joyous we all were as we drew near the island, after
ten days at sea! And how quick, in my own case, was the change from
joy to the anguish of suspense, when as my first greeting from home
I received the telegram which told me of a battle between life and
death which was being fought out under my own roof in far-away
England! It was almost with a superstitious dread of the news that
might be awaiting me now, that I found our ship running past St.
Paul’s Bay, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>
making straight for the narrow entrance to that harbour of Valetta
which is surely the grandest of all the harbours in the world.</p>

<p>But all gloomy thoughts and forebodings were swept clean out of
my mind as I looked up and saw waving above St. Elmo our glorious
English flag. What a thrill of pride shoots through the heart of
even the most pacific of Englishmen when after long travel by sea
and land he comes upon this noble island, and sees it standing
“compassed by the inviolate sea,” stern, self-possessed, ready if
needs be, to face a whole world in arms against it! Past St. Elmo
and St. Angelo, whose mighty guns frowned down upon our decks, we
came swiftly into the great harbour, where a hundred noble ships of
all nations were lying at anchor on one side, and the mighty
ironclads of the English Navy on the other. The church bells were
sending their shrill clang out upon the breeze—for when are the
bells of Valetta ever silent? Innumerable small boats, gaily
painted and emblazoned, according to the Maltese fashion, with
strange and unlifelike representations of cats and lions, of dogs
and camels, were swiftly darting across the harbour; and
the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span> houses that
rose tier above tier from the water’s edge until they reached the
giddy height of the Barecca, were brilliant with glass and colour,
and made home-like by the huge signs in which English names and
words appeared. How wonderful the contrast between this scene and
that upon which I was gazing at the same hour yesterday! I seemed
to have leaped at a single bound from the heart of the East into
England; from the remote middle ages into the closing quarter of
the nineteenth century.</p>

<p>The small craft swarmed round our steamer, and a score of
Maltese boatmen appealed to me to give them my custom when I left
the ship. But, first of all, certain formalities had to be gone
through. The health officers, the naval officer on duty for the
day, and the port authorities, boarded the vessel, and I found that
each passenger was required in turn to explain his identity and
business; for this was an Italian vessel arriving from an African
port. I was awaiting my turn in this tedious examination when one
of the officers passed near me. I asked him a question in English.
“What!” he said, “are you an Englishman? Then you can<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span> go on shore at once, sir.” It
was a strange contrast, this, to the treatment I had met with in
Tunis, where, between the French on the one hand and the Arabs on
the other, the Englishman is often treated very much as though he
were a Pariah; and where the mere fact of your being a Christian is
a source of danger and discomfort. I saw my Arab and Italian
fellow-passengers looking at me with envious eyes as I descended
the ladder. “Turn about is fair play, my fine fellows!” thought I
to myself; and I started for the shore in the humour of a schoolboy
just let loose for the holidays.</p>

<p>Nor did that feeling of buoyant animal spirits desert me during
the whole of that day. Remember that I had been living in constant
danger of attack, and amid much discomfort, for several weeks, and
here I was suddenly transported into that which is to all intents
and purposes an English town. Nay; it is in some respects more
English than England itself; for here the mere fact of your being
an Englishman suffices to secure for you the respect and deference
of the native population. Every true-born Briton who lands in Malta
is allowed, and even<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_245">[245]</span> expected, to strut about as though he were
lord of the manor. Is it in human nature for him not to feel
something of a Jingo under such circumstances? I hastened off to
the Post Office, and gave in my card. “You’ve been expected a long
time, sir,” said the clerk, smiling; and he drew forth an enormous
bundle of newspapers which had been slowly accumulating for weeks,
and a smaller pile of letters, which, to my intense thankfulness, I
found brought me nothing but good news. So now I was free to enjoy
myself. First, there was the inevitable bath and change of linen at
the Imperial Hotel. How wonderful it was to be treated with respect
by landlord and waiters, instead of meeting with the slightly
veiled insolence which had characterized the demeanour of the
worthies of my hotel at Tunis. Then I walked to the Union Club, and
found that my good friend Captain P——— had duly entered my name as
an honorary member. I declare that it made me feel positively
nervous to hear nothing but the sibilant whisper of the English
language all around me. I had only been out of range of my native
tongue for a few weeks; but I had been so<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_246">[246]</span> completely cut off from English
associations that it seemed as though months had elapsed since I
last met with a company of my fellow-countrymen. Presently Captain
P——— came in, finding me deep in a file of the <em>Times</em>. What
followed I shall only hint at. During the hot, thirsty days in
Tunis, when steaming coffee and detestable vermouth were the only
drinks procurable, I had more than once given utterance to my
longing for a bottle of English soda-water—slightly diluted. My
craving was satisfied now. Then I went off to Truefitt’s—for
Truefitt has an admirable branch establishment in the Strada Reale
at Malta—and had my hair cut as deftly as though I had been in Bond
Street. Finally, at dinner I found myself positively sitting next a
lady, and an English one, who moreover hailed from Yorkshire, and
talked to me accidentally about the qualities of the <em>Leeds
Mercury</em>. It was all like a dream, out of which I expected
every moment to awake and find myself—perhaps in Susa.</p>

<p>It was a lovely moonlight night, and I went up to the Barecca to
enjoy the view from that point. Far below me lay the<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span> glorious harbour of Valetta.
There were all the forts, commanding the narrow entrance, and ready
at any moment to encounter an enemy; within their embrace lay the
shining harbours; the two naval harbours showing their rows of
immense ironclads and other swift-steaming men-of-war, including
the <em>Inflexible</em> and the <em>Hecla</em>. Directly below me,
in the commercial harbour, were thirty large merchant steamers. It
was a noble sight. The white lines of the fortifications, the
outlines of the great Naval Hospital, the Government buildings and
the barracks, glimmered pale in the moonlight; whilst the twinkling
lamps of the little boats crossing the harbour burned red beneath
me. The whole scene was bathed in that atmosphere of perfect peace
which somehow or other men naturally associate with the rays of the
moon; though some of us have seen this same moon looking down,
serene and cold, upon sights so dreadful that merely to behold them
is to add years to a man’s life. Far away, from the deck of one of
the ships in the naval harbour, there rang the shrill blast of a
British bugle; and now quite near to me I heard a military band
playing our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span>
National Anthem; for not far from the Barecca—where once the old
Knights of Malta walked and looked down upon the splendid scene
below them—is the noble palace now used as the mess-room of the
Royal Engineers. Everything around me spoke of England, and of
England’s might; not of that might which we see developed at home
in our workshops and our factories, and our great provincial
cities; but of that might by means of which she won this marvellous
islet, set in the midst of this blue Mediterranean, and by which
alone she now holds it against a jealous Continent. Most Englishmen
at home are so far from warlike sights that they are apt to forget
that their country has after all shown herself great in war as well
as in commerce. But no man can forget that fact as he stands here
upon the Barecca of Valetta, and looks down upon the great forts
and the ironclads which sleep securely beneath their walls. I have
said that everything reminded me of home; but I ought to have made
one exception. There was nothing of England in that wonderful depth
of moonlit sky; nothing of our own atmosphere in the exquisite
balminess of this November night. When I<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_249">[249]</span> reached my hotel I removed the cartridges
from my revolver, and lay down to sleep in security under the
shelter of the English flag.</p>

<p><em>Malta, Saturday, Nov. 5th.</em>—I awoke this morning from
the midst of a nightmare dream, in which I found myself resisting
an attack from a large party of Arabs, led on—save the mark!—by
Afrigan, who had been suddenly converted into a fiend in a turban.
As I started from my sleep I heard a sound that recalled me to a
consciousness of my whereabouts. It was the loud jangle of
Christian church bells, and it brought home to me a delightful
sensation of rest and security. The day was bright and hot, and the
lovely peeps of the sea that you get from various street corners in
Valetta were as charming as ever. Surely in all Europe there is no
gayer, pleasanter place of abode than this white little island! The
Union Club, which I visited again this morning, claims the proud
distinction of having the largest membership of any club in the
world. Nearly all the officers of the Army and Navy who have at any
time been stationed in the Mediterranean are members; no
subscription being<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span>
exacted from them when they are not on the station. At this club,
too, you may meet many of the men of rank in the military and civil
services who are on their way to or from India, and who have taken
Malta <em>en route</em>. There are but few civilian members of the
club, though one or two of the English residents in Malta have been
admitted to it. The Maltese themselves are, I understand,
rigorously excluded. The appointments of the place are excellent.
Indeed, I almost imagined myself in Pall Mall, and in a favourite
corner of the Reform Club, as I sat reading the newspapers this
morning. During the winter season periodical balls are given by the
members of the club, and these are, I believe, the leading social
events in the island. Not to be invited to one of the club balls is
to meet with a grievous slight indeed. Altogether, the club is an
institution of which Englishmen have good reason to be proud, and
the advantages of which they are particularly well able to
appreciate when they come, as I have done, straight from the
semi-civilization of Tunis into the midst of the comfort and even
luxury that abound here.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[251]</span>I had promised
to lunch with Lieutenant D——— on board the <em>Hibernia</em> depôt
ship—a grand old wooden hulk, into which the crews of the different
vessels that are paid off here are turned pending their voyage to
England. Having got a boat, and finding there was some time to
spare before the hour fixed for lunch, I went round the
<em>Inflexible</em>, and duly admired her somewhat ponderous
proportions and enormous strength. It was immediately afterwards
that I was witness of one of the most stirring and touching scenes
I ever beheld, though doubtless it is a scene common enough at
Valetta. My boatman pointed to where the <em>Tyne</em>, one of the
noble government transports, was beginning slowly to move from her
moorings. She was “homeward bound,” carrying some hundreds of
time-expired men, the crew of the <em>Thunderer</em> and others,
who had been kept in the Mediterranean for several years. As the
great, stately white ship passed down the harbour, her sides and
rigging lined with the sunburnt faces of the sailors who were
starting for Old England, the crews of all the men-of-war she
passed, clustering like bees upon bulwarks, yard-arms, and ladders,
raised cheer upon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span>
cheer in such thunderous volumes as only the throats of Englishmen
seem capable of giving forth. Many a yearning glance was cast from
the other vessels as the homeward-bound craft steamed gently past,
her farewell signal to her old comrades fluttering in the breeze;
and I could well understand that these tremendous salvoes of
hurrahs were meant as much for the dear mother country itself as
for the men who were departing. Then, above the roar of thousands
of voices, there rose the strains of “Home, sweet Home,” from the
band of the <em>Hecla</em>. And so the good ship <em>Tyne</em>,
amid all this waving and shouting and music—and with more than one
wet eye wistfully regarding her—slipped out between St. Elmo and
St. Angelo, and turned her head towards home. It was a thrilling
scene for an Englishman to behold in that noble harbour, under that
cloudless southern sky.</p>

<p>Alas! when I myself reached Plymouth, some ten days later, I
found the <em>Tyne</em> lying there close to the spot where my own
ship cast anchor for the night; and I read in the morning paper how
she had brought home so many men from this vessel and so many from
the other, and how “one death had occurred<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_253">[253]</span> on board during the voyage.” So one at
least of those who had set out so joyfully on that lovely morning,
amid the strains of “Home, sweet Home,” and the hurrahs of
thousands of English sailors, had reached the end of his voyage and
the haven of rest even sooner than he had expected to do.</p>

<p>After lunch—one of those cheery, pleasant meals, flavoured with
bright professional gossip, which only the ward-room of a
man-of-war knows—my host and I set off for the Naval Hospital to
see the grave of my poor friend P———, whom I left at Malta last
year. It was a hot and exhausting climb from the level of the
harbour to the height upon which the beautiful hospital is
situated. What a treat it was, however, after seeing something of
French sanitary arrangements at Tunis, to observe the delightful
cleanliness and order prevailing here! After all, it is not merely
by the weight of its guns and the magnitude of its forts that Malta
impresses you with a sense of the greatness of your country. You
see here what the English faculty of organization can accomplish
even in the face of serious difficulties. Malta lies far south of
any town on the continent of Europe; and yet its<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span> streets are as clean and as
free from the horrible smells of Germany and Italy as any English
town is. I think, upon the whole I felt more proud of this
cleanliness of Valetta than I did even of the great forts, and that
wonderful storehouse of grain in which, according to tradition,
food for the whole population sufficient to last for seven years is
always stored.</p>

<p>I started at four o’clock from Malta for Naples by the
<em>Elettrico</em>, a beautiful paddle steamer, said to be the
crack boat of the Florio line. Certainly it presented a marked
contrast to the <em>Sicilia</em>, in which I had made the passage
from Tunis to Malta. A beautiful saloon, large and airy
state-rooms, and a handsome quarter-deck well provided with
comfortable seats, gave the <em>Elettrico</em> the appearance of a
very fine yacht rather than of an ordinary passenger steamer. That
I had now got into one of the main routes of English traffic was
proved by two facts: first, that all my fellow-passengers in the
saloon—five in number—were English; and next, that the captain, a
handsome, middle-aged Italian, spoke our language with remarkable
freedom and an excellent accent. The<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_255">[255]</span> <em>Elettrico</em> danced along over the
waves at a wonderful rate. I sat on deck enjoying the moonlight on
the water for several hours, but already I was beginning to feel
the difference between the “sunny south” I had left behind me and
the latitudes I was now approaching, so that I was by no means
sorry to turn into my warm and comfortable cabin.</p>

<p><em>Sunday, November 6th.</em>—I rose at six o’clock, to find
the splendid snow-clad peak of Etna directly opposite to me. We
were running through the lovely Straits of Messina, and the
prospect on both sides was delightful. Both to right and left there
were ranges of olive-clad hills, with white villages at their base,
and here and there a farmhouse glittering in the sunshine far up
the mountain slope. It was a civilized and fertile land on which I
was thus looking, and it contrasted strangely with the yellow and
lifeless hills of Africa. My view of the grand summit of Etna did
not last very long; for as the sun rose higher in the heavens
clouds began to gather round the mountain top, and very soon
blotted it from my view. About seven we came in sight of
Messina—one of the most beautiful cities in the world. It lies
stretched in a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[256]</span>
noble semicircle round the edge of the bay; whilst behind it is a
great amphitheatre of hills, which are wooded to the very summit,
and bear on their flanks castles and farm-houses, churches and
monasteries; so that you get here an admirable intermixture of
nature and civilization. The city itself, with its forts, its
cathedral, and its imposing line of buildings on the quay, looks
wonderfully picturesque. The straits are at this point so narrow
that they look like a river; and the mainland of Italy, with hills
covered with thick chestnut forests, seems but a stone’s throw from
the town. There were a great many English vessels in the harbour,
all engaged in taking in lemons, which are at this season the
staple export of Messina. But even more welcome than the sight of
these English ships, was the appearance of my old friend the
<em>Charles Quint</em>. I had learned during the passage from Malta
that the <em>Elettrico</em> would remain two days at Messina,
whereas the <em>Charles Quint</em> was to sail for Naples this
evening, so that I might save a day by transferring myself to her.
My mind was soon made up, and directly after breakfast I went
aboard the French boat. I found the<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_257">[257]</span> jovial captain and my friends the purser
and the doctor sitting at their morning meal. They uttered a cry of
surprise and pleasure at seeing me, and forthwith began to recount
their varied experiences since we had parted at Susa. Both of “the
Corsican brothers” had been deplorably ill during the gale which I
had encountered in the <em>Ville de Naples</em>. They were in their
element now, however, in these smooth straits, and with all the
evidences of civilization around them.</p>

<p>And yet, are things quite what they seem in this beautiful
Sicily? To my great surprise, the captain of the <em>Charles
Quint</em> told me that yesterday, when his vessel was lying in the
harbour of Catania, he was twice shot at from the shore whilst he
was walking on the bridge! I expressed my astonishment at this
statement, and asked him if he might not have been mistaken. He
declared, however, that he could hear the bullets whiz past his
head; and his story was confirmed by the purser and doctor. When I
asked him what could be the reason for such an outrage, he shrugged
his shoulders and said, “It is the affair of Tunis, I suppose.”
Perhaps, however, there may be a little jealousy of a<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_258">[258]</span> more vulgar description at the
bottom of the outrage. This is, it appears, the first voyage of the
<em>Charles Quint</em> by this route, and as it is known that she
is a French vessel running in opposition to the Italian line, it is
just possible that trade rivalry led to this resort to the Sicilian
method of settling a dispute. The bitterness of the people here
against the French is, however, intense. Whilst I was in the saloon
of the <em>Charles Quint</em> this morning, the agent, a very
handsome young Italian, came on board. He and the captain forthwith
plunged into a political discussion, which it was mighty pretty to
witness. The agent of course dwelt upon the perfidy of the French
in Tunis, and charged them with having gone there simply to rob the
Italians of a property which would very soon have been in their
possession but for this interference. The captain dilated with
warmth upon the ingratitude of the Italians, who thought nothing of
the sacrifices France had made for them. They became so angry at
last that I had to throw myself into the midst of the dispute as a
champion of the Arabs, who wanted neither a French nor an Italian
master. Then the sudden storm subsided. The disputants<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_259">[259]</span> nodded their heads in
acquiescence, and jointly admitted that the best solution of the
difficulty would have been for both countries to agree to leave
Tunis alone.</p>

<p>I went ashore for a walk through the town. The church bells were
ringing with a deafening noise, and people were streaming along the
streets in the direction of the cathedral and the other churches,
in crowds which reminded me of an English town on a Sunday morning.
Falling in with the stream, I presently found myself in one of the
churches; it was that which had the loudest bells. It was crowded
in all parts, and to my surprise I found that there were almost as
many men as women in the congregation. The women were very
handsome, but the men contrasted very unfavourably with the
personal appearance of the Arabs among whom I have been mingling
lately. A civil verger brought me a chair, and I sat down and
joined in the service—as well as I was able. But I could hear
little and see nothing of the officiating priest, and I fear my
attention was turned rather to the magnificent silver shrines which
the church contained and to the congregation<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_260">[260]</span> around me, than to the high altar and
the officiating clergyman there. The people preserved a very
reverent demeanour during the service, though it was a little
startling to see blind beggars being led round among the crowd
soliciting alms. One could not fail, in observing the gorgeous
magnificence of this interior, the wealth and beauty of the shrines
before which the humble peasants bowed, to acknowledge that the
Church of Rome knows how to provide for the wants of its
members—knows how to attract and awe them. What an impression must
be produced upon the wild mountaineer, who comes down to Messina to
confess, by this splendid interior, by the roll of the noble music
through the great aisle of the church, by the beauty of the painted
ceiling and the silver images! What a contrast all this
magnificence must present to the dull squalor of his daily life!
Though it would be absurd to generalize from my limited experience,
I must say that what I saw in Messina on this Sunday morning fully
confirmed the statements made to me as to the intense devoutness of
the Sicilians—a devoutness which is, unfortunately, not<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_261">[261]</span> incompatible with a belief in
the virtues of brigandage and of other pursuits and practices
which, in more temperate climes, are looked upon with a certain
degree of disfavour.</p>

<p>After listening to a sermon in another church, which, like that
which I first entered, was crowded, I went into the Cathedral. It
was empty, but I was allowed to inspect the magnificent high altar,
one of the noblest specimens of Florentine mosaic in existence.
Agates, jaspers, chalcedonies, and other precious stones, are here
cunningly wrought into many quaint devices of birds and flowers,
inlaid upon a groundwork of lapis lazuli; and as, in spite of the
centuries which have elapsed since this <em>chef-d’œuvre</em> left
the hands of the master, all these stones retain their pristine
colours, the general effect is marvellously rich. I saw, too, the
coffin of “Alfonso the Magnanimous,” King of Sicily, and the
wonderful picture of the Virgin which the pious Messinese believe
to have been painted by St. Luke—St. Luke, whose crumbling tomb was
gravely pointed out to me a year ago at the foot of Mount Pion, in
the midst of the ruins<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_262">[262]</span> at Ephesus!—and I had a narrow escape from
seeing sundry other relics more precious still, to wit, the arm of
St. Paul, the blood of St. Mark, the skull of Mary Magdalene, and
the hair of the Virgin. Was ever city favoured as this beautiful
Messina seems to be! After a walk through the streets, with their
quaint carved fronts and grotesque fountains, I returned to the
<em>Charles Quint</em>, and in the evening we started for Naples.
About nine o’clock we ran between Scylla and Charibdis, the one
being represented by a lighthouse, and the other by a black rocky
promontory; but I saw nothing of the terrors which the ancients
beheld here. Just as I turned in for the night we were abreast of
Stromboli, on the top of which a light cloud of smoke was
resting.</p>

<p><em>Naples, Monday, November 7th.</em>—I rose early, in order to
see our entrance into the Bay of Naples; and was rewarded on going
on deck by a wonderful spectacle. There was a long line of sharply
defined hills on the starboard side, lying black against the dark
night sky; but away to the south, it seemed as though the curtain
of night had been lifted, and here a low streak of
brilliant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[263]</span> flame
showed itself, and against it the hills stood out in splendid
vividness. Slowly the dawn stole over sea and sky, painting both
with a hundred rainbow tints. On our port quarter lay the beautiful
island of Capri, a picturesque mass of grey rock rising ghostlike
from the silver sea. And now the sky changed to an exquisite salmon
colour, whilst the sea shone like white metal. Then the sun
gradually broke through the rift in the cloud-barrier, and as he
did so the faint salmon and the silver-grey tints faded out of
sight, and pink and blue became the prevailing colours. All this
time the sea was as smooth as glass, and our stately ship glided
almost noiselessly over it. Presently, when the beautiful sunrise
effects had disappeared before the broadening day, light clouds
began to spread themselves over the sky; but they did not prevent
my seeing Vesuvius, with its cap of thick smoke, and lovely
Sorrento amid its groves of lemons and olives; and by and by the
long line of the white houses of Naples appeared at the bottom of
the bay, with the Castle of St. Elmo towering far above them; and
almost before we were aware, we were at anchor in a
crowded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[264]</span> harbour,
and were feasting our eyes upon the famous southern city.</p>

<p>And here I may well pause in this story of my trip to Tunis. I
had once more reached the mainland of Europe. I was within easy
reach of home, and though I loitered a few days in Naples, hearing
much whilst I was there of the indignation prevailing throughout
Italy at the conduct of France in poaching upon what the Italians
had begun to regard as a preserve of their own, I do not know that
my readers would be greatly interested in the story of my life from
day to day. I left Naples by the steamship <em>Liguria</em>, of the
Orient line, and after a very quick but monotonous voyage of six
days, landed at Plymouth, on Wednesday, November 16th.</p>

<p class="sch">POLITICS IN TUNIS.</p>

<p class="csum">A survey of the situation — M. Roustan’s policy —
The first campaign — The Treaty of the Bardo — The insurrection —
Bombardment of Sfax — Occupation of Tunis — March upon Kairwan —
Capture of Kairwan — Results of the French policy — English
interests — Estrangement of Italy.</p>

<p class="nind"><span class="sc">I have</span> completed the record
of my visit to Tunis, but I shall hardly have accomplished my whole
task until I have said something regarding the remarkable political
situation which I found in existence there. From the foregoing
pages I have excluded politics as far as possible; but the
political problem which Tunis at this moment presents to the world
is so remarkable, that it is impossible to pass it by unnoticed;
and I shall attempt, therefore, in this concluding Chapter, by
giving some extracts from my diary referring to this aspect of my
visit, to convey to the reader an idea of the state of things
existing in the Regency at the time when I was there. Those who
trouble themselves<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[266]</span>
to read these pages will see that more than once I have indulged in
the gratuitous blunder of prophesying. My prophecies were not only
written on the dates mentioned, but were printed a few days
afterwards in the <em>Standard</em> newspaper. I do not think
however that my predictions as to what must be the result of M.
Roustan’s adventures in Tunis have proved to be very far wrong.
Writing several weeks before the famous Roustan-Rochefort trial, I
gave in outline most of the facts which were brought to light
during the course of that trial, and upon some other points of
interest, such as the probable action of the insurgent Arabs after
the fall of Kairwan, I foretold with tolerable accuracy what has
actually come to pass. Let me say at once, however, that the credit
of this is not due to me, but to those clear-sighted and
dispassionate men with whom I had the good fortune to be brought in
contact during my stay in the Regency, and who did so much to
enlighten my mind as to the real nature of the situation existing
there.</p>

<p>And here it may be proper to observe, by way of showing that
England is not without<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_267">[267]</span> an interest of her own in Tunisian
politics, that not fewer than 10,000 subjects of the Queen are to
be found in the Regency. It is perhaps hardly necessary to say that
these are almost all Maltese, the number of actual Englishmen in
the Regency being probably under twenty. As coachmen, boatmen,
gardeners, artisans, and coffee-shop keepers, the Maltese find
plenty to do in all parts of Tunis. Their moral character is not
very high, and at times they give her Majesty’s Consul-General not
a little trouble; but they are English subjects, protected by
treaty; and it is the undoubted duty of our government to watch
over their interests. That recent events in Tunis have not been
very favourable to these persons is only too certain. Some thirty
British subjects have been killed during the course of the war
between the French and the Arabs, and an enormous quantity of
property, belonging not merely to Maltese, but to English merchants
trading through agents in the Regency, has been destroyed. The loss
of life is chiefly due to the Arabs; but the loss of property is
almost entirely due to the French, who have peculiar notions as to
the rights of neutrals,<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_268">[268]</span> where a question of loot is concerned.
English trade with Tunis is very large. The esparto grass, which is
exported from Sfax and other places on the coast, is almost all
brought to this country; and the name of one English firm, Messrs.
Perry, Bury, and Co., of Manchester, seemed to be on the lips of
all the traders in the Gulf of Hammamet. England as a great
consumer of the products of Tunis, naturally supplies that country
in turn with many of the articles required by her inhabitants, and
it was pleasing to see that genuine English goods—Manchester
cottons, Sheffield knives, and London pickles, sauces, and tinned
meats—enjoyed a practical monopoly in the towns of the Regency. It
is not, therefore, correct to represent this country as having no
interest in Tunis. At the same time it would be a mistake to
exaggerate the extent of that interest, or to give way to any
imaginary fears, because France, by one of the most cynical acts of
aggression on record, has made herself the mistress of the
destinies of the country. Her act is a serious one so far as the
Italians are concerned; but England, so long as she retains Malta
can afford to look on at the endless<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_269">[269]</span> schemes and counter-schemes of the rivals,
with something like indifference.</p>

<p>When I reached Tunis the second act in the comedy devised by M.
Roustan was in full progress. The Bey had succumbed to the
inevitable, when the French Consul waited upon him in his palace at
Manouba, and, pointing to the Republican troops drawn up within
sight of the windows of the room where they were seated, warned the
unlucky Ruler that the occupation of Tunis would be immediately
effected, unless the treaty which was presented to him were signed.
Those who were in Tunis at that time know what anguish prevailed,
not merely at the palace but in the capital, during this crisis.
Mr. Reade had been the adviser of the Bey up to this point. His
Highness had placed himself entirely in his hands, and the English
Consul-General had given him the best possible counsel. It was at
Mr. Reade’s instigation that the Bey had not only desisted from
offering any resistance to the progress of the French troops
through his territory, but had despatched his brother, the heir
apparent, Si Ali Bey, at the head of the Tunisian army, for the
purpose of cooperating with the<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_270">[270]</span> French commander in his operations against
the “Kroumirs.” Everybody in Tunis knew then what everybody in
France knows now, that the ravages of the so-called Kroumirs were a
mere pretext for the invasion of the Regency, and that the
expedition was sent forth in the interests of French financiers,
who found their interests threatened by the schemes of Italian
rivals.</p>

<p>The first and natural wish of the Bey was to oppose the French
invasion by force; for he was perfectly conscious of the fact that
the Republic had not the shadow of justification for its attack
upon his territory. Mr. Reade, by his urgent solicitations induced
the Bey to abstain from the fatal step of resistance; he even went
further, and, as I have shown, got him to send his own brother and
the Tunisian army, not to oppose but to cooperate with the French.
In the meantime, it was hoped that by urgent diplomatic
representations to the different courts of Europe some steps might
be taken to avert the impending catastrophe. M. Roustan and his
friends were greatly disappointed when they learned that the Bey,
by the wise advice of Mr. Reade, was not going to fall<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_271">[271]</span> into the trap they had laid
for him, by offering any resistance to the advance of the French
troops. To most men this step on the part of his Highness would
have seemed a fatal bar to further action on their part. M.
Roustan, however, did not allow himself to be materially hindered
by the Bey’s discreet conduct. Abandoning even the semblance of a
pretext he brought the French troops up to the village of Manouba,
within four miles of Tunis, and within sight of the Bardo and the
Bey’s private palace. Then, as we have seen, he presented his
monstrous treaty for signature. The Bey’s agony, as I have said,
was intense. He knew that to permit the occupation of Tunis would
be to seal his own doom. Henceforth he would be merely a puppet in
the hands of M. Roustan, and the greater part of his Arab subjects
would treat him with the contempt due to a traitor. On the other
hand, he could not fail to see that the Roustan treaty was merely
the prelude to the seizure of his sceptre by the French. With the
aid of Mr. Broadley, an English barrister, he drew up a dignified
protest against the action of France, and telegraphed this to all
the courts of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[272]</span>
Europe, during the few hours which his hard taskmaster was good
enough to allow him for consideration. Up to the date of my leaving
Tunis—November 3rd—not one of the recipients of this protest, which
was sent off in May, had found time to acknowledge its receipt. So,
deserted by Europe, and alas! no longer allowed to feel confidence
in Mr. Reade’s power to help him, the Bey signed the treaty, and
placed himself in the hands of M. Roustan.</p>

<p>This was the first act of the comedy. It was followed by an
interval, during which there was apparent peace in the Regency.
Mustapha, the barber’s boy who had become Prime Minister, was
shipped off to Europe, and M. Roustan installed himself as master
of the land. All manner of concessions were granted to French
companies. Railways, harbours, agricultural banks, public works of
every description were projected. The Italians found themselves
driven to the wall. Even English subjects, like Mr. Levy, saw their
rights rudely interfered with; for M. Roustan was master, and all
others had to submit. But presently there came a change. The French
troops were returning<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_273">[273]</span> to their own country. It did not suit the
purpose of the Ministry to allow the people of France to imagine
that anything like a war was in progress. So it was announced in
the Chambers that the Treaty of the Bardo had settled everything,
and that it was no longer necessary to keep any large army of
occupation in Tunis. It was at this moment that the insurrection
broke out at Sfax. The Arabs there proclaimed themselves
independent of the Bey, who had sold them to the infidel, and
invited their countrymen to join them. The first news of this
insurrection was sent up to Tunis by Mr. Gallia, our Vice-Consul at
Susa, who happens to have also a residence and place of business at
Sfax. Mr. Gallia’s reward was to have his house plundered by the
French troops when they entered Sfax. Of the bombardment of that
place by the French, and of its capture, and the loot by the
victorious troops, I need only say here that it resulted in the
spread of the insurrectionary feeling throughout the Regency. The
whole Arab race boiled over with indignation; and outrages, and
murders as horrible as that which occurred at the railway station
at Oued Zergha, became<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_274">[274]</span> common. The French troops were hurried back
to the Regency; three columns were formed for the advance of an
army against Kairwan, the sacred city, which was suspected of being
the centre of disaffection, and Tunis itself was occupied by a
large force of Republican troops. It was at this moment that I
arrived in the Regency, and from this point the following extracts
from my letters will afford some idea of the political
situation.</p>

<p><em>Tunis, October 18th.</em>—It is difficult to convey to the
mind of the English reader an idea of the state of things now
prevailing in Tunis, at a distance of barely four days from London;
and it would probably be still more difficult to make any man of
ordinary honesty understand the full meaning of that drama—half
comic half tragic, and wholly disreputable—which is now being
played out by the most cynical of actors under the eyes of the
entire world. The visitor to Tunis at this moment finds himself in
a country in which a state of war prevails. At Goletta immense
French transports may be seen, disembarking troops and stores
sufficient for a campaign against Germany. All along the short line
of railway between the port and the capital, French<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_275">[275]</span> camps are scattered; trains of
artillery may be seen in slow progress towards the front, and
ambulances provided with all the appliances which modern surgery
has invented are also visible. Here, in Tunis, French sentries are
mounted upon the crumbling white walls of the Kasbah, the great
citadel of the place; French camps are pitched in the open spaces
within the forts; French patrols pass through the streets at
regular intervals, and the Grand Hotel, where a French general is
installed, is the real headquarters of the Government of the city.
Yesterday three columns of French troops, numbering in all some
30,000 men, began their march—two from the neighbourhood of Tunis,
one from Susa—towards the sacred city of Kairwan, which has been
selected as the special place to be honoured by a demonstration of
French valour. If ever there was a country in a state of war, it is
Tunis at the present moment. And yet no war has been declared; no
pretext for military operations has been discovered, and a portion
at least of the Parisian press maintains that no war exists. Even
more startling than the contrast between the state of things
visible here, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[276]</span>
that in the existence of which official France pretends to believe,
is the contrast between the condition of Tunis now and its
condition twelve months ago, or even more recently.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the present year there was no European
country which could vie in peacefulness, in security of life and
property, with Tunis. There were of course certain tracts of wild
mountainous country in the north-west portion of the Bey’s
territory, where it would have been unsafe for any European to
venture. But apart from these very limited districts, there was no
part of Tunis where life was not perfectly safe. So recently as
last April, Lord and Lady Bective visited Kairwan; and they not
only did so in perfect safety, but they were received as honoured
and welcome guests by the Arabs of that famous city. Here in Tunis
no one thought for a moment of any danger from the native
population. The tourist could wander at his will among the
interesting ruins which abound in the neighbouring country, not
only without dread of being subjected to violence, but with a
feeling of absolute security which he could hardly entertain in
London or Paris. Now, all this is changed.<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_277">[277]</span> No man would dare to travel half a dozen
miles from the city—to do so would be to court almost certain
death. It would be almost as dangerous to venture into any of the
villages which lie under the very shadow of the walls of Tunis. And
even within the city itself, Europeans are warned on no account to
venture out after dark. If you walk through the Arab quarter,
averted faces and muttered curses meet you on every side; while the
air is filled with rumours of an impending catastrophe. Twice
during the present week the French troops in the city have been
roused in the dead of night, and marched hurriedly to a central
point, in order to resist a general rising of the Arabs, which
everybody expected, and which it was believed had already begun.
The imaginations of the non-Mussulman population, stimulated by all
that they see around them, are still further excited by the
horrible and, alas! true stories of tortures perpetrated upon
unhappy Christians who have fallen into the hands of the Arabs; and
everywhere a feeling not only of insecurity but of positive dread,
has replaced that which prevailed last year. And these are the
first results of that famous treaty<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_278">[278]</span> which M. Roustan wrung from the Bey less
than six months since, and by which France, or rather her Consular
Agent, was made absolute master of the properties and the destinies
of the Tunisian Government and people. It is obvious to everybody
now that a fatal blunder was made by the French Cabinet when it
placed itself in the hands of M. Roustan. It is a blunder which has
already cost an enormous sum of money, and a serious expenditure of
life, and it is one which may yet have consequences of the gravest
kind, affecting not merely France but other European countries
whose interests are still dearer to the Englishman.</p>

<p>It is not my business, however, to enter into a political
disquisition on the origin and objects of the Tunisian expedition.
I have done my duty when, as an eye-witness, I point out the
extraordinary results of the Roustan policy up to the present
moment. That policy has, in the first place, compelled France to
enter upon a war on a large scale against a nation with whom it
professedly has no quarrel; and, in the second place, it has
entirely destroyed the security of life and property in Tunis, and
has made one of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[279]</span>
most peaceful and harmless races in the world, the bitter enemies
not merely of France, but of all the powers and peoples of Europe.
With more than 50,000 French soldiers in Tunis, and yet with the
very streets of the capital itself in such a state that Europeans
dare not move about them freely, it can hardly be contended that
the civilizing and pacifying mission of the French Consular Agent
has been altogether as successful as might have been desired. As to
the secret history of that mission—the history which is upon the
lips of everybody in Tunis—it is not for me to tell it here; but
there is some probability that the revelation of the truth will not
be long delayed. M. Camille Pelletan and other French deputies have
come to Tunis for the special purpose of learning the truth on the
subject; and some startling revelations may be expected when the
debates begin in the Chambers.</p>

<p>Within the next fortnight it is believed that decisive military
operations will have been carried out against Kairwan. Yesterday,
as I have stated already, three French columns started for that
place. The first column, under the command of General Saussier,
to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[280]</span> whom the command
in chief is entrusted, has started from Tunis, and advances by way
of the famous Enfida estate. The suggestion made here is, that this
column will accomplish a double purpose; it will not only aid in
the conquest of Kairwan, but will put the French in possession of
that particular piece of property the name of which was mixed up so
prominently with the early history of the Tunisian question. The
second column, under General Logerot, has marched from Zaghouan,
and will make a slight <em>détour</em> to the west, on its way to
the sacred city. The third has the port of Susa as its point of
departure; and it is to advance by means of a temporary railway
which is to be constructed to Kairwan. The distance from Susa to
Kairwan is barely thirty miles, so that there ought to be no
difficulty in the construction of this line. Another column,
intended for the pacification of the country as well as the
conquest of Kairwan, is now moving across the Bey’s territory from
Tebessa. The distance it has to traverse is, however, so great that
it can hardly take part in the operations against the city itself,
unless those operations should be unexpectedly delayed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[281]</span>No one, of
course, can entertain any doubt as to the result of the operations
against Kairwan. The famous city is doomed. Optimists now can only
pray that its captors will show respect for the feelings not merely
of the Mussulman, but of the whole civilized world. The “loot” of a
place like Kairwan would be a disgrace and a disaster. The world as
it watches this great expedition against Kairwan, undertaken, as I
have shown, upon a scale of such magnitude, ought to bear in mind
the fact that Kairwan itself has been guilty of no offence. It has
offered, and is offering, no resistance to the French army,
although naturally enough the Arabs of Kairwan, like the rest of
the world, fail to see what special reason can be alleged for the
course now being pursued by France in a country with which it does
not pretend to be at war, and which it professes that it has no
desire to annex. No plea of military necessity can therefore be put
in on behalf of the expedition to which the French are now
committed. It is an expedition undertaken for the purpose of giving
the Gambettist Republic a new dose of “glory,” and of putting an
end, if possible, to awkward discussions<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_282">[282]</span> in the French Chambers. That is the plain
truth about this march upon the sacred city—a march which is
regarded by all the Arabs, I need hardly say, as being in itself an
act of sacrilege. That it will not result in the pacification of
the country is firmly believed by competent military authorities
here. The Arabs, save a few of the more fanatical, will in all
probability escape into the mountainous districts of the interior,
or—and this is an eventuality which it is necessary that English
statesmen should seriously consider—they will make their way across
the frontier into Tripoli, and throw themselves into the arms of
the great Mussulman force already assembled there, where they will
nurse their indignation against the assailants of their brethren in
race and religion.</p>

<p><em>Tunis, October 25th.</em>—The truth about Tunis has not yet
been told to the world. Part of it has, it is true, been revealed
in the columns of certain of the ultra-Radical journals of Paris;
but, partly because of the quarter in which the revelations have
been made, and partly, also, because of the evident bias of the
writers, those stories have not attracted so much attention as they
might<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[283]</span> reasonably
have been expected to do. It will not, however, be from any want of
zeal on the part of inquirers after it, if the whole truth
regarding the Tunisian question is not made known to the world at
no distant date. This city is now swarming, I shall not say with
spies, but with investigators of all descriptions, bent upon
learning everything regarding the proceedings of M. Roustan and his
wonderful <em>entourage</em>. We have here, among others, M.
Camille Pelletan, the lieutenant of Dr. Clémenceau, and M. Pelletan
does not even affect to conceal the fact that he is preparing the
materials for a savage indictment, not merely of M. Roustan and the
French Ministry, but of M. Gambetta himself, when the Chambers
meet. That he is satisfied with the success that has attended his
efforts to unravel all the mysteries of the Tunisian question, I
have the best authority for saying; and there can be no doubt that
when he makes his promised statement to the Chamber of Deputies he
will have a tale to tell which must produce a very lively
sensation. It is not only, however, among French Deputies and
Special Correspondents that the inquiries after the
truth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[284]</span> are to be
found. Strange as it may seem, at least one other country besides
that immediately concerned in the Tunisian expedition is
interesting itself in what is passing or has passed here. Tunis has
lately witnessed a remarkable influx of mysterious
Germans—gentlemen, for the most part, of a decidedly military
bearing, whose sauerkrautish French would alone suffice to betray
their nationality to the observant. These gentlemen are by no means
obtrusive in their demeanour. They frequent none of the hotels;
they might even seem to be anxious to escape the observation of the
French authorities. They are chiefly to be found in certain small
cafés in the European quarter which do not appear to have been
discovered as yet by the officers of the French army. Here they
are, however, and for what purpose? They are not bent on seeking
pleasure. It is only a mad Englishman who will come to Tunis for
pleasure at a time like the present. They are not engaged in
commercial pursuits; they are not even the correspondents of German
newspapers. All that can be said about them is that they show a
most unwearied assiduity in collecting facts, both
political<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[285]</span> and
military, with regard to the past and the present of French rule in
Tunis. They also will aid the world, it may be assumed, in arriving
at a full knowledge of the truth regarding one of the most
remarkable episodes in modern history.</p>

<p>And what is that truth? For obvious reasons my pen is restrained
from writing of it. It will be better to wait till the debate in
the French Chambers for the full chronicle of the scandals that
surround this question; yet even now not a little may be said. I
see it still repeated in certain newspapers in England, that after
all the French have only done in Tunis what we did in Afghanistan.
More amazing ignorance of actual facts than that which is shown by
this assertion, it would be difficult to conceive. Granting for the
moment that our policy in Afghanistan was as bad as these papers
believe it to have been, there would still be not even the faintest
similarity between the two cases. I have never seen it hinted that
we entered Afghanistan in order to advance the pecuniary interest
of a coterie of adventurers at Calcutta or London; nor has it ever
been suggested that a fair and frail Helen was closely
connected<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[286]</span> with the
origin of our expedition to Cabul. It is said here, however, upon
authority which is unimpeachable, that the violent seizure of Tunis
by the French, and all the misery, loss of life, and confusion that
have resulted from that step, can be traced directly to the visit
of a certain Tunisian lady to Paris, and to the acquaintances she
there formed amongst a band of well-known financiers. This lady had
exceptional influence over a very powerful person in Tunis. She had
exercised similar influence over other powerful persons in the
place before she made the acquaintance of this particular
gentleman, and altogether she occupied a very extraordinary and
important place in Tunisian affairs. On the particular visit to
Paris to which I refer, her sympathies were enlisted on behalf of
the speculators in question. She returned to Tunis resolved to
procure for them a most important concession from the Bey—a
concession which would practically have placed the greater part of
the country in pawn to them. By means of the gentleman whose
movements she controlled, she brought the matter under the notice
of the Bey. His Highness, however, refused to grant the<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_287">[287]</span> concession, pleading the
perfectly accurate reason that he could not do so without violating
his treaty engagements with England and other countries. Thereupon
he was bluntly told that he would live to repent his decision; and
that the concession he had been asked to make voluntarily was
trifling compared to that which would within twelve months be wrung
from him by force. In fact, it was by no means obscurely hinted
that the days of his rule and of Tunisian independence were
numbered. Little more than six months afterwards the “ravages” of
the Kroumirs were discovered; French journalists declared it to be
intolerable that their country should be exposed to insults and
injuries at the hands of a horde of savages; and one of the
gentlemen who had been most urgent in seeking the concession of
which I have spoken from the Bey, himself proposed in the Chamber
of Deputies that an expedition should be undertaken for the purpose
of vindicating the dignity of France, and chastising the
aggressors. From that expedition came, I need hardly say, the
Treaty with M. Roustan, the cession of Bizerta and a considerable
tract of territory, the submission of the Bey’s Government
to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[288]</span> that of France,
and now the occupation of Tunis itself and the practical conversion
of the Regency into a French dependency.</p>

<p>All these facts have been hinted at, if they have not been
clearly stated before; but it is well that they should be stated
again. Connected with them are numberless scandals, some of so
flagrant a character that I cannot even hint at their nature. But,
as I have said, the searchers after truth are abroad, and we shall
have a highly spiced dish of Tunisian facts served up in the French
Chambers at no distant date. The Enfida case, which is one of the
side issues connected with the affair, is in itself a very
remarkable instance of the manner in which those who represent
France in this country are trifling with the national honour. A few
months ago, before the great blow had been struck, and when Tunis
was still independent, the French authorities, after much
correspondence, professed themselves anxious to submit Mr. Levy’s
claim to arbitration. England saw then no reason for withdrawing it
from the ordinary tribunals. Suddenly, however, the attitude of
France has undergone a curious change. Now that Tunisian
independence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[289]</span> is
completely at an end—now that the Bey is little more than a
prisoner in his own palace—now that the French flag floats above
the Tunisian one on the towers of the Kasbah, and now that French
soldiers and policemen are patrolling the streets of Tunis
itself—now, in fact, that France is omnipotent and can control or
crush any Tunisian institution, M. Roustan has turned round upon
himself, refuses to submit the Enfida dispute to arbitration, and
has actually sent it before one of those local tribunals the
integrity and competency of which he stoutly denied so long as
there was the remotest chance of their acting in an independent
manner. I am glad to say that the English Government seem to be
inclined to insist upon arbitration by some wholly independent
party as the only satisfactory solution of the question, and in
this resolve it may be hoped that the French Government will
eventually acquiesce.</p>

<p>The diplomatic struggles and rivalries of places like Tunis are
proverbial, and there is no need to say that the hottest warfare
has been waged here between the representatives of the different
European powers. I am glad to say that amid the strife Mr.
Reade,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[290]</span> the English
representative, has been able to keep himself entirely aloof from
all personal jealousies or local scandals; and that, whilst
maintaining with firmness and dignity the interests and honour of
his country, he has not given offence even to the most arrogant of
his colleagues. On the other hand, M. Roustan is now being
denounced by everybody, and particularly by Frenchmen themselves.
Except in his own immediate circle nobody seems to have a good word
for him, and his early downfall is freely predicted. Among the
offences laid to his charge are the contradictory promises he is
said to have made to many of the prominent actors in this Tunisian
question. He is believed to have intrigued not merely with the Bey,
but with his Prime Minister, the ex-barber’s-apprentice Mustapha,
with Ali Bey, the Bey’s elder, and with Taib Bey his younger,
brother. It follows from all that has happened, and from all that
is now being brought to light, that Frenchmen themselves are most
anxious to secure his removal. The misfortune is, that his removal
will now exercise but small appreciable influence upon the future
of Tunis. It is in the possession of France at this
moment.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[291]</span> The noble
Gulf of Tunis, the trade of the country, all its strategical
points, are in the keeping of the French; and though the latter
will have to pay a heavy price in blood, money, and reputation for
the prize they have thus secured, they are not likely to relinquish
it merely because M. Roustan has been exposed and punished.</p>

<p>It is not merely on the side of the French that curious
intrigues are just now in full progress under one’s very eyes. The
Bey, as I have said, is practically a prisoner in his palace at
Goletta, utterly dejected and heartbroken, and so completely devoid
of spirit that he has just conferred—need I say at whose
bidding?—his highest decoration upon the French general commanding
the troops in occupation of Tunis—an occupation which every Arab
resents as an insult to his nationality and his creed. It is not
surprising in these circumstances that rumours should be current
regarding a probable change in the nominal rulership. Ali Bey, the
next brother of the Bey, who is known as the Bey of the Camp,
eagerly puts himself forward as the supplanter of the reigning Bey.
Unfortunately for his chances he is very deaf, and, moreover,
he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[292]</span> is more than
suspected of complicity in many of the intrigues of M. Roustan. His
own troops are at this moment in a state of almost open mutiny
against him, and more than once he has been denounced when riding
through his own camp, as a traitor who had sold his country. The
third brother, Taib Bey, lives a retired life at the Marsa, in a
large and beautiful country-house, not far from the residence of
the English Consul. He seems to be a man of considerable shrewdness
and intelligence. Last of all on the list of Pretenders is
Mustapha, whose friends openly declare that he is about to return
to this country as Governor-General—a French Governor-General of
course. I should imagine, however, that his chances are dependent
upon the fortunes of his friend M. Roustan.</p>

<p><em>Tunis, October 30th.</em>—There is something very amusing in
the manner in which the capture of Kairwan has fallen flat upon the
European community here. How the intelligence may have been
received in Paris I am not of course aware. Perhaps the <em>coup de
théâtre</em> of General Farre and M. Roustan may have been
successful, and the Parisians<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_293">[293]</span> may have applauded the occupation of the
sacred city as though it were an achievement equal to another
Solferino or Magenta. But here even the dullest of persons sees too
much of what is passing behind the scenes to be deceived. It was
known early last week that Kairwan was to be occupied exactly in
time to allow of the news reaching Paris on Friday evening. The day
before, I received a note from an officer with General Etienne’s
force, dated Tuesday, and telling me that they were in sight of
Kairwan, never having fired a shot during the march. I was
therefore quite prepared for the receipt of the news of the
occupation. On Friday morning, about ten o’clock, the transport
<em>Sarthe</em> steamed into Goletta, bringing the expected
tidings; and two hours afterwards everybody in Tunis was—laughing
at it. The prodigious achievement, which was to crush the
insurrection and strike terror into the hearts of the Arabs in
North Africa, had resolved itself into a simple promenade across
forty miles of sandy desert, and the holy city had been yielded up
without a blow being struck in its defence. It was quite evident
that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[294]</span> the Arabs were
too clever to fall into the trap which had been so ostentatiously
laid for them by the French. A battle at Kairwan would, according
to French ideas, have justified the destruction of the city; whilst
it would at the same time have crippled the power of the Arabs. But
the Arabs are as far from subjection as they ever were.</p>

<p>We have a fresh instance of mismanagement in this capture of
Kairwan. The plan of campaign was that the two columns of Susa and
Zaghouan should meet in front of the city on Tuesday last. Somehow
or other, however, they “missed their connexions,” as the Yankees
would say. General Etienne performed his part; General Saussier,
the superior officer, failed in his. Although he encountered but
trifling resistance, his straggling and ill-arranged column could
not arrive at Kairwan on Wednesday night. The funny thing is, that
there is much indignation among the leading officers here against
General Etienne! It is said that it was his first duty to await the
arrival of his superior, and that he has shown “indecent haste” in
fulfilling his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[295]</span>
instructions and reaching and occupying Kairwan. General Etienne,
however, is the only man who has shown himself up to his work
during this campaign. The work has not been very heavy, but such as
it is he has done it well. On reaching the city, Colonel de Moulin
was sent forward to communicate with the Governor, one of the Bey’s
servants, and a man of much intelligence. A white flag had
previously been hoisted on the tower of the great Mosque of Okba.
The Governor explained to Colonel de Moulin that he was the loyal
subject of the Bey, and was prepared to receive the French army as
the allies of his Highness. He only begged that the mosques might
be held inviolate, and that the army would be content with passing
through the town, and would not attempt to take up quarters in it.
Colonel de Moulin asked the Governor to come with him to the spot
where General Etienne was awaiting the result of the interview.
This the Governor did. After some conversation the French general
intimated that he must take possession of the Kasbah, or citadel
within the walls, but that in all other respects he would comply
with the Governor’s wishes. The<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_296">[296]</span> French column was thereupon formed up, and
each battalion being headed by its trumpeters marched into the
sacred city to the sound of shrill martial music. The streets were
crowded with Arabs, arrayed in their burnouses of many colours, and
all watched with interest the passage of the troops. Anger and
indignation were depicted upon every countenance. Very little else
was to be seen that was worthy of notice by the unwelcome guests
for whom the city had opened its gates.</p>

<p>The streets are narrow, tortuous, and ill-paved; the houses of
the prevailing Moorish type; and the great mosques are not
particularly conspicuous so far as their exteriors are concerned.
Within they contain many noble columns and antiquities, and
<em>curios</em> of enormous interest and value. But no one was
allowed to violate these shrines, within which no Christian foot
has yet penetrated. There was general disappointment on the part of
all when, the march through having been finished, the troops were
brought out of the city, at the opposite gate to that by which they
had entered. The detachment occupying the<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_297">[297]</span> Kasbah was a small one, General Etienne
feeling justified, in the absence of all resistance, in making this
concession to the wishes of the Governor. He had previously given
the latter to understand that he would hold him personally
responsible for the maintenance of order within the walls. The
situation chosen for the camp is good. It is within easy distance
of the city, and has been entrenched—not because there is any fear
of attack from the people of Kairwan themselves, but because of the
possibility of a sudden raid from the neighbouring hills, into
which the insurgent Arabs have fled for refuge.</p>

<p>Such is the story of the occupation of Kairwan by General
Etienne; and it will be seen at once how tame a story it is. But
though there has been nothing brilliant in this mean achievement,
and though the struggle with the Arabs has been hardly advanced a
single step by the occupation of this city, it has a degree of
importance. The excitement and resentment among the Arab population
of the Regency has been greatly intensified by an outrage upon a
shrine which they have long regarded as sacred.<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_298">[298]</span> Here in Tunis, the Arabs
openly declare that the insult thus put upon their faith must be
avenged in blood; and outside the city walls the populace is
seething with rage. The hope which apparently prevails is that the
Sultan may come to their assistance even now, and that with the aid
of his troops they may avenge themselves upon the invader. It is to
put an end to this hope that the Bey has been induced, or
compelled, to issue a proclamation to his people. This
proclamation, which appears on all the walls in the Arab quarter,
states that the Sultan has sent his troops to Tripoli merely to
preserve order, and that they are now about to be withdrawn. Still,
the very fact that it should have been thought necessary to issue
such a notice, shows how strongly the French are impressed with a
sense of the danger which threatens them on that side. Nor is their
anxiety groundless. Advices from Tripoli show that the excitement
among the Mussulman population there is intense, and is being
fomented by the action of fanatical preachers, who are passing from
place to place, stirring up popular<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_299">[299]</span> hatred against the infidel. Many hundreds
of Tripolitans, including a large number of Turkish soldiers, have
crossed the frontier, and are joining the Tunisian Arabs in these
mountain fastnesses, in which they are preparing for the guerilla
operations they evidently contemplate. It is, therefore, in that
direction that the Tunisian question will probably next appear in a
serious form.</p>

<p><em>Malta, Nov. 5th.</em>—The rains were beginning to set in
over Tunis when I left the Regency, and with the commencement of
the rainy season the best authorities were agreed in believing that
the fighting would cease. The Arabs have spent several months,
during which no work could be done upon the land, in assailing
their hated enemy, and they have inflicted upon him not only severe
losses, but the necessity of taking the most costly and extensive
measures for maintaining his hold upon the country. Now that the
time is come when the natives must either attend to their fields or
allow the next harvest to be entirely lost, those who know them
best feel convinced of the course they will take. They will leave
the mountains and come down to<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_300">[300]</span> the plains, not to fight, but to work. A
few months hence, when the harvest has been secured, there will
probably be another insurrectionary movement, which will break out
sporadically in all manner of unexpected places, and cause fresh
trouble and expense to the French. For the present, however, there
will be something like peace, save where General Saussier pursues
his favourite occupation of having some unfortunate Bedouin hanged,
simply to encourage the others. The moment seems, therefore, a
favourable one for attempting some review of the situation as a
whole.</p>

<p>Whatever may be thought about the morality of the transactions
which have placed the French in command of Tunis—and I have spoken
already with quite sufficient plainness on that point—the English
public must make up their minds to one thing—that is, that France
will not quit her hold of the prize she has now got within her
grasp. I have spoken to many Frenchmen of influence and position
who have visited Tunis during the past month for the purpose of
learning the truth about the Tunisian question. There is not one of
them who does not admit that<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_301">[301]</span> the series of transactions which have ended
by placing the tricolor on the Kasbah of the capital and the walls
of Kairwan reflect dishonour upon the national name; there is not
one who is not prepared to insist upon the exposure and punishment
of M. Roustan and his <em>entourage</em>. But I have not met a
single Frenchman who has expressed his willingness to retire from
the country now that he sees France in actual possession of it.
“What! give up Tunis now, after all the lives and the money we have
spent in getting hold of it! Give it up after the tremendous price
in honour we have paid to secure it! Never!” This is the French
view of the matter; and even the Englishman who has been educated
by recent transactions in Afghanistan and South Africa, must admit
that there is some force in the prevailing French sentiment upon
the subject. But whether that sentiment be just or not, let us at
least not shut our eyes to the plain fact which stares us in the
face—the fact that, whether M. Roustan is retained or dismissed,
whether his conduct is denounced or applauded, nobody believes that
France will retire from Tunis. There she is, and there she will
stay, if for no other reason<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_302">[302]</span> than because she has now such extensive
financial interests in the country, that the clique of capitalists
and jobbers who secretly control her foreign policy cannot afford
to let those interests be sacrificed. But what must be the probable
consequences of her retaining the prize she has succeeded in
seizing by an act of international brigandage?</p>

<p>So far as other powers are concerned, there can be no doubt that
Italy is the heaviest sufferer for the moment. The interests of
Italy in Tunis far surpass those of any other country. Italian has
hitherto been the European language used there in all commercial
transactions; Italian capital has been most largely invested in the
native industries; and the vast majority of the Christian
population have hitherto claimed the protection of the Italian
Consul-General. The Italians themselves will not deny that they
have for a long time entertained a desire to do that which France
has now done. They were the keen and eager rivals of Frenchmen in
all the various enterprises designed for the development of Tunis.
But either they were less bold or were more scrupulous than
their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[303]</span> competitors.
At all events they had no M. Roustan to take the lead on their
behalf, and thus, when the moment for action arrived, they were
left hopelessly behind. It is impossible to exaggerate the rage and
bitterness which now fill them against the French. If the two
nations were actually at this moment at war with each other, the
feeling could not be more hostile. Nor need we be surprised at
this. The loss of the Italians in actual money in consequence of
this transfer of Tunis to France is a very heavy one. The French,
it must be understood, are not doing things by halves. They are
already boasting that they will soon drive the last Italian
capitalist out of Tunis, that the Goletta Railway (the purchase of
which by an Italian company was the incident which fired the train
of subsequent events) will soon be in their hands, and that before
long they will be financially and commercially supreme.</p>

<p>All this the Italians see for themselves, and they are
overwhelmed with chagrin at the spectacle. But they feel also that
their <em>prestige</em>, and even their military position, has
received a most serious blow. With the French at Bizerta and
Goletta they maintain<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_304">[304]</span> that they are unexpectedly outflanked.
Various schemes have been put forward in Italy in order to secure
some compensation for the injury thus inflicted upon the country. I
find that in the important coast towns the favourite idea of the
Italian residents is that Tripoli should be seized, in order to
counterbalance the French acquisition of Tunis. But at Tripoli
itself that idea finds no favour, even among the Italians; and the
reason for this it is not difficult to discover. Neither from a
financial, a military, nor a political point of view is Italy
strong enough to secure Tripoli. Those who are on the spot are well
aware of this, and they are most anxious to counteract the
Chauvinist ideas of their fellow-countrymen at a distance. Let me
add, that France herself would be worsted in any attack upon
Tripoli. She may have the money and the men, but she lacks the
power necessary to enable her to defy, not merely the Tripolitan
Arabs, but the forces of united Europe. For the Italians to thrust
themselves into the wasp’s nest from which the insurrectionary
movement in Tunis originated, would be an act of supreme folly. To
say nothing of the course which England would be bound
to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[305]</span> take in such a
case—to say nothing of any resistance which might be offered by the
regular Turkish army—the Arabs of Tripoli are themselves formidable
enough to make any attack upon them by a State like Italy, a most
dangerous if not a hopeless undertaking. They are far more
fanatical than their co-religionists in Tunis; they are rich and
brave; and at this moment they are eager to throw themselves across
the border in order to revive the insurrectionary movement in the
Regency. The attempt of any Christian power to interfere with them
on their own territory would be the signal for the outbreak of a
“Holy War,” compared with which that which has been waged in Tunis
would be utterly insignificant.</p>

<p>Let me state, in proof of what I say as to the spirit which
animates these Tripolitan Arabs, that I have ascertained during my
trip down the coast that a subscription is actually being raised in
Tripoli among the wealthier Moors for the equipment of a local
militia, which may be ready to take its part in that war of race
and religion for which every Tripolitan longs so earnestly. Italy
must therefore give up the idea of Tripoli<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_306">[306]</span> as an utterly hopeless one. It is difficult
to see in what other direction she can obtain the compensation she
covets. Nothing, for example, can counterbalance the French
occupation of Bizerta, that noble harbour which may justly be
styled the pride of North Africa—a harbour which, if improved, at a
comparatively small expenditure, may be made equal to the
requirements of the greatest naval power in the world. It has been
suggested that Italy, which now holds Pantellaria, might convert
that island into a naval and military position of value. No doubt,
looked at simply upon the map Pantellaria seems to be in an
admirable strategical position. It appears to guard the Malta
channel and to cover the Tunisian coast. But I have been to
Pantellaria, and I find it destitute of anything in the shape of a
harbour. It can never vie either with Goletta or Bizerta as a naval
station; and to make it even a position of moderate strength would
demand that which Italy cannot afford—the expenditure of an almost
unlimited amount of money.</p>

<p>It does not seem, therefore, that the Italians can obtain any
adequate compensation for the loss of influence they have
sustained<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[307]</span> through
the action of the French. They must just submit, as other nations
have had to do before them, to the aggressions of the strong. But
the temper in which they have accepted that which they conceive to
be the loss and humiliation to which they have been subjected does
not bode well for the future peace of Europe.</p>

<p>I turn now to the position of England, and to the effects upon
our own country of the French action in Tunis. In the first place,
it cannot be doubted that down to the beginning of the present year
the political position of England in Tunis was incomparably better
than that of any other power. This was partly, it must be admitted,
due to the exceptionally favourable way in which we were
represented at the Court of the Bey. Mr. Reade has not only
personal qualities and a vast experience which combine to make him
a peculiarly able and powerful representative of his country in a
State like Tunis, but he is the owner of that which in this part of
the world may be called a really great name. His father, Sir Thomas
Reade, who lies buried in the little English cemetery at Tunis, was
for many years the most powerful and<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_308">[308]</span> popular personage in the country. He was
known by all the Arabs not as “the English Consul,” but as “the
Consul.” Mr. Reade himself was born in Tunis, and his return to it
to fill the place once occupied by his father was hailed with
universal delight by the Tunisians themselves.</p>

<p>But since the signature of the May treaty he has occupied an
entirely different position. Up to that time he was regarded as the
representative of the nation which was the disinterested friend of
Tunis; and from the Bey downwards the people of the country
consulted him and trusted him. Since then, however, it has been
seen that England either will not or cannot interfere to save the
Regency from the clutches of the French; and as a natural and
inevitable consequence, Mr. Reade is no longer regarded as a
powerful mediator on behalf of Tunis. In one word, our political
influence in the country, once all-powerful, has now been
completely destroyed, as the result of the French aggression. That
our commercial influence will suffer can hardly be doubted. At
present England supplies Tunis with the greater part of the
European goods she consumes. Manchester,<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_309">[309]</span> Birmingham, Sheffield, and London stock her
bazaars, and everywhere in the shops familiar English names meet
the eye. But this cannot last under the existing state of things.
The French are pushing their way with the keenest anxiety to drive
us out of the market, and they are not slow to turn political
events to their own advantage and to our detriment. We must
therefore lose considerably from what has taken place in Tunis;
whilst the position of our Maltese fellow-subjects, who have
hitherto led prosperous lives there, must necessarily be changed
very much for the worse.</p>

<p>There is, however, one point on which England suffers no
material injury from French aggression in Tunis. So long as she
continues to hold Malta she can afford to leave France to do as she
pleases at Bizerta and Goletta. Neither of those ports can ever
really compare in military strength with our grand harbour of
Valetta; while the position of Malta, in the very centre of the
Mediterranean, gives it strategical advantages of which no North
African port can boast. I say nothing of what has been done by the
Englishmen of past generations to increase<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_310">[310]</span> the military and political value of Malta,
though as one stands on the Barecca and surveys the splendid lines
of fortification protecting the impregnable harbours in which our
ironclads float in security, one cannot but feel grateful to the
men who not only won this place for us, but who have guarded it
since so well. Italy may feel that she has been outflanked by the
seizure of Tunis; England, from the white heights of Malta, can
watch the proceedings of the French with complete equanimity.</p>

<p>It remains for me to say a few words as to the effect of this
Tunisian aggression upon France herself. Every man who is
acquainted with the facts must feel that France will have to pay an
enormous price for the “conquest” of M. Roustan—a price not to be
measured in blood, money, or honour alone. She is already
experiencing some of the results of the policy into which she has
been lured. The exposure of military weakness and incompetence
which has been made during the course of the campaign—a campaign
which has been jealously watched on the spot by German
observers—has done much to destroy the <em>prestige</em> and
influence she was rapidly<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_311">[311]</span> acquiring at Berlin. Prince Bismarck may
now make his mind easy. The war of revenge is postponed
indefinitely. But, on the other hand, Italy is not only estranged,
but outraged. People in England have little idea how intense is the
feeling of anger burning in the breasts of the Italians at this
moment. You must go to Italy in order to learn the truth upon this
point. The old sentiment of friendship which showed itself so
strongly in 1870, no longer exists, and the Italians are longing
for a chance of punishing France for what she has done in Tunis.
The Arabs, again, are for ever estranged from their conquerors.
They cannot hold their own against them. They have no arms capable
of competing with those of France; nor have they military
knowledge. But it is safe to predict that for years to come, under
the new state of things, both in Algeria and Tunis there will be a
constant waste of French life and money—a waste which might have
been avoided but for the intrigues of M. Roustan. And at any moment
France may find herself confronted by a deadly peril. She may have
to choose between a dangerous rebuff in Tunis itself, and an attack
upon Tripoli—an attack<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_312">[312]</span> which would bring her into collision not
only with Turkey, but with England, Italy, and Austria. Such are
the Dead Sea apples borne by the tree she is now watering with her
blood in Tunis.</p>
